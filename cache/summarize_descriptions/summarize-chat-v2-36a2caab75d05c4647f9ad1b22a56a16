{"result": "在描述中，我们遇到了两个与\"TEXTS\"实体相关的段落。第一个段落提到一个辅助文本引用并可能直接引用或讨论主要文本中的某个焦点；或者扩展了圣经叙事，填补了主要文本沉默的空白。第二个段落进一步说明，除了上述情况外，在犹太教的aggadic midrash中，辅助文本还会在主要文本沉默的地方扩展圣经叙事，填补空白。\n\n综合这两个描述，我们可以得出结论：一个辅助文本与主要文本有联系，它可能直接引用或讨论主要文本中的某个焦点。在某些情况下，特别是当涉及到犹太教的aggadic midrash时，辅助文本会进一步扩展圣经叙事，通过填补主要文本中未提及的部分来增加细节和理解。这种关系展示了文本之间的相互补充和解释作用，在学术研究、文学分析以及宗教阐释等领域具有重要意义。\n\n简而言之，\"TEXTS\"实体之间的关系体现了文本间的引用、讨论与扩展，特别是在犹太教的aggadic midrash中，辅助文本通过填补空白来深化对圣经叙事的理解。", "input": "\nYou are an expert in Natural Language Processing (NLP) research and development. You are skilled at designing innovative algorithms that enhance the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in integrating external knowledge sources through retrieval-augmented techniques like Open-RAG, ActiveRAG, and RAVEN. Your expertise also extends to uncertainty quantification methods for assessing the reliability of LLM-generated content across various domains such as few-shot learning, multimodal tasks, and scientific NLP applications.
