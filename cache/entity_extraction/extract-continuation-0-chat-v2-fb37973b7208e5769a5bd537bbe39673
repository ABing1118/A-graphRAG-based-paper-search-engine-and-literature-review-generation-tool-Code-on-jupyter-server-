Given their computational cost, these models are difficult to replicate without significant capital. For the few that are available through APIs, no access is granted to the full model weights, making them difficult to study. We present Open Pre-trained Transformers (OPT), a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters, which we aim to fully and responsibly share with interested researchers. We show that OPT-175B is comparable to GPT-3, while requiring only 1/7th the carbon footprint to develop. We are also releasing our logbook detailing the infrastructure challenges we faced, along with code for experimenting with all of the released models.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-05-02,\n    authors: ['Susan Zhang', 'Stephen Roller', 'Naman Goyal', '\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"L log L\") in time complexity and memory usage, and has comparable performance on sequences' dependency alignment.

(iii) the generative style decoder, while conceptually simple, predicts the long time-series sequences at one forward operation rather than a step-by-step way, which drastically improves the inference speed of long-sequence predictions. Extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets demonstrate that Informer significantly outperforms existing methods and provides a new solution to the LSTF problem.\n\nIn 2020, Haoyi Zhou et al., published their work on Informer, a model designed for time series forecasting with notable improvements in computational efficiency and performance. The paper highlights three key features of the Informer model:\n\n1. **Efficient Time Complexity**: Informer operates with an \"(L log L)\" time complexity and memory usage, making it efficient for processing sequences.\n2. **Self-Attention Distillation**: This feature allows the model to highlight dominant attention by halving cascading layer input, which is particularly effective in handling very long input sequences efficiently.\n3. **Generative Style Decoder**: Conceptually simple yet powerful, this component predicts long time-series sequences in a single forward operation, significantly speeding up inference for long sequences.\n\nThe paper also mentions that extensive experiments on four large-scale datasets show Informer outperforming existing methods and providing an innovative solution to the Long Sequence Time Forecasting (LSTF) problem.\n\nOn the other hand, OPT: Open Pre-trained Transformer Language Models is a suite of decoder-only pre-trained transformers ranging from 125M to 175B parameters. This model aims to be fully shared with interested researchers while maintaining its performance comparable to GPT-3 but with significantly reduced carbon footprint for development. The authors also provide an infrastructure logbook and code for experimenting with all the released models, aiming to democratize access to large language models.\n\nThe publication date for OPT is 2022, indicating a more recent advancement in the field of pre-trained transformer language models that emphasizes both performance and environmental responsibility."}]}
