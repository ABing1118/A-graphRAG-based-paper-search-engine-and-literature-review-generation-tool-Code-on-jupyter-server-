For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.

To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

The survey includes several evaluation methods of RALMs, emphasizing the importance of robustness, accuracy, and relevance in their assessment. It also acknowledges the limitations of RALMs, particularly in retrieval quality and computational efficiency, offering directions for future research. In conclusion, this survey aims to offer a structured insight into RALMs, their potential, and the avenues for their future development in NLP.

However, these facility and instrument upgrades come with a significant increase in complexity. Driven by more exacting scientific needs, instruments and experiments become more intricate each year. This increased operational complexity makes it ever more challenging for domain scientists to design experiments that effectively leverage the capabilities of and operate on these advanced instruments. Large language models (LLMs) can perform complex information retrieval, assist in knowledge-intensive tasks across applications, and provide guidance on tool usage. Using x-ray light sources, leadership computing, and nanoscience centers as representative examples, we describe preliminary experiments with a Context-Aware Language Model for Science (CALMS) to assist scientists with instrument operations and complex experimentation. With the ability to retrieve relevant information from facility documentation, CALMS can answer simple questions on scientific capabilities and other operational procedures.\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"ALMs demonstrate utility in tasks\", \"title\"),\n(\"translation and dialogue systems\", \"tasks\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive applications\", \"tasks\"),\n(\"several evaluation methods of RALMs\", \"survey includes\"),\n(\"robustness, accuracy, relevance\", \"evaluation aspects\"),\n(\"limitations of RALMs\", \"acknowledged limitations\"),\n(\"retrieval quality\", \"specific limitation\"),\n(\"computational efficiency\", \"specific limitation\"),\n(\"future research directions\", \"research directions\"),\n(\"structured insight into RALMs\", \"survey aim\"),\n(\"potential and future development in NLP\", \"insight scope\"),\n(\"Github Repository\", \"supplementary resource\"),\n(\"Yucheng Hu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yuxing Lu\", \"author\"),\n(\"opportunities for Retrieval and Tool Augmented Large Language Models\", \"title\"),\n(\"advanced scientific user facilities upgrades\", \"facility context\"),\n(\"next-generation x-ray light sources\", \"facility example\"),\n(\"nanoscience centers\", \"facility example\"),\n(\"neutron facilities\", \"facility example\"),\n(\"spectrum of the physical sciences\", \"understanding scope\"),\n(\"life sciences to microelectronics\", \"science spectrum\"),\n(\"increased complexity\", \"facility operational challenge\"),\n(\"domain scientists\", \"target users\"),\n(\"instrument design and operation\", \"scientific tasks\"),\n(\"capabilities of advanced instruments\", \"instrument leverage\"),\n(\"large language models (LLMs)\", \"tool augmentation\"),\n(\"complex information retrieval\", \"LLM capability\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks assistance\", \"application context\"),\n(\"guidance on tool usage\", \"usage support\"),\n(\"x-ray light sources\", \"example application\"),\n(\"leadership computing\", \"example application\"),\n(\"nanoscience centers\", \"example application\"),\n(\"Context-Aware Language Model for Science (CALMS)\", \"described model\"),\n(\"instrument operations assistance\", \"model purpose\"),\n(\"complex experimentation guidance\", \"model capability\"),\n(\"facility documentation information retrieval\", \"information source\"),\n(\"simple questions on scientific capabilities\", \"query example\"),\n(\"operational procedures\", \"additional query context\")\n"}]}
