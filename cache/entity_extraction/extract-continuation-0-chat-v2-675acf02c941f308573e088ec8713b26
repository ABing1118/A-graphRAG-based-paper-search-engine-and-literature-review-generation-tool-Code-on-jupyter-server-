The technique combines elements from vector databases and knowledge graphs to enhance both the retrieval accuracy and answer generation quality in question-answering tasks, particularly within financial domains. It demonstrates that by integrating context from both vector databases and knowledge graphs, it outperforms traditional methods like VectorRAG (which relies solely on vector databases) and GraphRAG (which uses knowledge graphs alone). The authors show improvements across retrieval accuracy and answer generation metrics.\n\n**Document 2**: This document is about the Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns conference held in Versailles, France. It covers a range of topics related to image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, and their applications.

have created milestones in text (GPT-3) and text-to-image (DALL-E and CogView) generation. Its application to video generation is still facing many challenges: The potential huge computation cost makes the training from scratch unaffordable; The scarcity and weak relevance of text-video datasets hinder the model understanding complex movement semantics. In this work, we present 9B-parameter transformer CogVideo, trained by inheriting a pretrained text-to-image model, CogView2. We also propose multi-frame-rate hierarchical training strategy to better align text and video clips. As (probably) the first open-source large-scale pretrained text-to-video model, CogVideo outperforms all publicly available models at a large margin in machine and human evaluations.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-05-29,\n    authors: ['Wenyi Hong', 'Ming Ding', 'Wendi Zheng', 'Xinghan Liu', 'Jie Tang'],\n    score: 160.81659019404054\n},\n{\n    title: Do Transformers Really Perform Bad for Graph Representation?,\n    abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a dominant choice in many domains, such as natural language processing and computer vision. Yet, it has not achieved competitive performance on popular leaderboards of graph-level prediction compared to mainstream GNN variants. Therefore, it remains a mystery how Transformers could perform well for graph representation learning. In this paper, we solve this mystery by presenting Graphormer, which is built upon the standard Transformer architecture, and could attain excellent results on a broad range of graph representation learning tasks, especially on the recent OGB Large\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"title\", \"Large-scale Pretraining for Text-to-Video Generation via Transformers\", \"Xiang Ren\", \"Allyson Ettinger\", \"Za誰d Harchaoui\", \"Yejin Choi\", 161.08703099443997)\n(\"title\", \"CogVideo: Large-scale Pretraining for Text-to-Video Generation via Transformers\", \"Wenyi Hong\", \"Ming Ding\", \"Wendi Zheng\", \"Xinghan Liu\", \"Jie Tang\", 160.81659019404054)\n(\"title\", \"Do Transformers Really Perform Bad for Graph Representation?\", \"Za誰d Harchaoui\", \"Yejin Choi\", 160.81659019404054)"}]}
