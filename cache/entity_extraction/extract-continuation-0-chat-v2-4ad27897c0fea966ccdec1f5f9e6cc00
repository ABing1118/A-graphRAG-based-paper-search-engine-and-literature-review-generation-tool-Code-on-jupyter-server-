We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-03,\n    authors: ['Ryan Barron', 'Ves Grantcharov', 'Selma Wanna', 'M.

Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLMs with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines, especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval-augmented generation.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-02,\n    authors: ['Youna Kim', 'Hyuhng Joon Kim', 'Cheonbok Park', 'Choonghyun Park', 'Hyunsoo Cho', 'Junyeob Kim', 'Kang Min Yoo', 'Sang-goo Lee', 'Taeuk Kim'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: Mindful-RAG: A Study of Points of Failure in Retrieval Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text but often struggle with knowledge-intensive queries, particularly in domain-specific and factual question-answering tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution by integrating external knowledge sources, such as structured knowledge graphs (KGs). While KG-based RAG approaches have demonstrated value, current state-of-the-art solutions frequently fall short, failing to deliver accurate and reliable answers even when the necessary factual knowledge is available. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of failure points in existing KG-based RAG methods, identifying eight key areas of concern, including misinterpretation of question context, incorrect relation mapping, and ineffective ambiguity resolution. We argue that these failures primarily stem from design limitations in current KG-RAG systems, such as inadequate attention to discerning user intent and insufficient alignment of retrieved knowledge with the contextual demands of the query. Based on this analysis, we propose a new approach for KG-RAG systems, termed Mindful-RAG, which re-engineers the retrieval process to be more intent-driven and contextually aware. By enhancing reasoning capabilities, improving constraint identification, and addressing the structural limitations of knowledge graphs, we aim to improve the reliability and effectiveness of KG-RAG systems. To validate this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept by integrating the principles of Mindful-RAG into an existing KG-RAG system. The Mindful-RAG approach seeks to deliver more robust, accurate, and contextually aligned AI-driven knowledge retrieval systems, with potential applications in critical domains such as healthcare, legal, research, and scientific discovery, where precision and reliability are paramount.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-16,\n    authors: ['Garima Agrawal', 'Tharindu Kumarage', '\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"SMART-SLIC\", \"2024-10-03\", [\"Ryan Barron\", \"Ves Grantcharov\", \"Selma Wanna\", \"M.
