The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

Return output in The two documents you've provided cover distinct areas of research in computer science and information retrieval, each with its own set of methodologies and applications.\n\n**Document 1**: This document focuses on the development of a technique called HybridRAG (Hybrid Retrieval and Generation) for improving question answering systems. The technique combines elements from vector databases and knowledge graphs to enhance both the retrieval accuracy and answer generation quality in question-answering tasks, particularly within financial domains. It demonstrates that by integrating context from both vector databases and knowledge graphs, it outperforms traditional methods like VectorRAG (which relies solely on vector databases) and GraphRAG (which uses knowledge graphs alone). The authors show improvements across retrieval accuracy and answer generation metrics.\n\n**Document 2**: This document is about the Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns conference held in Versailles, France. It covers a range of topics related to image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, and their applications. However, since there's no specific abstract provided for this document, it's difficult to summarize its content precisely without additional context or details on individual papers presented at the conference.\n\nIn summary, Document 1 is about advancing question answering systems through a novel technique that combines vector databases and knowledge graphs, while Document 2 encompasses a broader spectrum of research topics related to image analysis and pattern recognition. as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2.
