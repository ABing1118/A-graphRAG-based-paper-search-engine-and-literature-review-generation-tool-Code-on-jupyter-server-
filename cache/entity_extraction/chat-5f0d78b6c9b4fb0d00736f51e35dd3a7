Identify and extract all the entities that match the types above. For each identified entity, gather:\n   - entity_name: The exact text of the entity, capitalized if it’s a title or a name.\n   - entity_type: Must be one of [paper_title, author, publication_date, abstract].\n   - entity_description: A concise description of the entity’s role or content.\n   Format for each identified entity:\n   (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. Among the identified entities, find any pairs (source_entity, target_entity) that have a *clear and direct* relationship in the text. For each such relationship, gather:\n   - source_entity: the entity_name (step 1) for the first entity\n   - target_entity: the entity_name (step 1) for the second entity\n   - relationship_description: a short explanation why these two entities are related\n   - relationship_strength: integer from 1 to 10 (the stronger the connection, the higher the number)\n   Format for each relationship:\n   (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. After finishing steps 1 and 2, output the results as a single list in text form, using **##** as the delimiter between records. That means each entity or relationship is one record, separated by **##**. No JSON, just plain text with these custom tuple delimiters and record delimiters.\n\n4. If any of the text is in a different language or is partially missing, please do the best possible extraction from the available data.\n\n5. If the text has no relevant entities or relationships, output an empty list followed by <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n\nExample 1:\nentity_types: [paper_title, author, publication_date, abstract] \ntext: { title: HybridRAG: Integrating Knowledge Graphs, abstract: We propose a technique ... publicationDate: 2024-08-09, authors: ['Alice', 'Bob'], score: 123.45 }\nOutput could be:\n(\"paper_title\"|HYBRIDRAG: INTEGRATING KNOWLEDGE GRAPHS|paper_title|The official title of the paper) ##\n(\"author\"|ALICE|author|One of the authors of the paper) ##\n(\"author\"|BOB|author|One of the authors of the paper) ##\n(\"publication_date\"|2024-08-09|publication_date|The date this paper was published) ##\n(\"abstract\"|We propose a technique ...|abstract|A short synopsis of the paper’s content) <|COMPLETE|>\n\n\nExample 2:\nentity_types: [paper_title, author, publication_date, abstract] \ntext: The second paper is titled \"Advances in Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,\" and it was published in 2005.
