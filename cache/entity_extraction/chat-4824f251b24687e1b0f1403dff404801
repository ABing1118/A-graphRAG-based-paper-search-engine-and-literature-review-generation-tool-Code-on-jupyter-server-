The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The real world in which they operate, however, is full of complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty. In this year’s Turing Lecture, Professor Chris Bishop discusses the field of machine learning, and shows how uncertainty can be modelled and quantified using probabilities. Professor Bishop will look at the recent developments in probabilistic modelling that have greatly expanded the variety and scale of machine learning applications, and he explores the future potential for this technology. 4.2 Integrative Analysis of Pathology, Radiology and High Throughput Molecular Data Joel Saltz, Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University The talk is available at: http://www.nesc.ac.uk/action/esi/download.cfm?index=4459. Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Text mining, computational biology and human disease 32 Integrative analysis of multiple complementary types of information is playing an increasingly essential role in biomedical research. The Emory led caBIG In Silico Brain Tumor Research Center is an excellent example of this. The effort is designed to leverage complementary molecular, pathology, radiology and outcome data, obtained by several large scale National Cancer Institute studies including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study. This group is developing workflows consisting of novel image analysis algorithms and bioinformatics analyses to correlate imaging characteristics defined by Pathology and Radiology derived feature sets with underlying “omic” characteristics and with patient outcome. This effort is explicitly designed both to motivate advances in informatics and to generate useful brain tumour research results. A major technical focus of the In Silico Brain Tumor research Center is high throughput digital microscopy, which combines image acquisition with generation of semantically annotated feature sets that describe tissue characteristics of disease at a cellular scale. This is a data intensive process; a high-power microscope can easily generate several terabytes of data each day. Tissue characterisation involves workflows that employ a sequence of steps: image segmentation, feature construction, feature selection, feature extraction, classification of features, and annotation of images and image regions. The sheer size of image datasets makes gleaning information from digital microscopy slides a data-intensive process requiring efficient system support. The large number of potentially useful micro-anatomic features and the large number of image preprocessing algorithms makes it essential to develop effective semantically oriented mechanisms to manage, query and curate features and to track provenance associated with the generation of each collection of features. More information about the work is in [86, 87, 88, 89]. 4.3 Text mining, computational biology and human disease Andrey Rzhetsky, Department of Medicine, Department of Human Genetics, Computation Institute, Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology, University of Chicago The talk is available at: http://www.nesc.ac.uk/action/esi/download.cfm?index=4472. Imagine that a graduate student enters the Library of Congress with an assignment: she is to find and pull all texts relevant to protein glycosylation. Her problem is straightforward, known among text-miners as information retrieval (IR). If the student must not only find the books, but also to flag the most important concepts she encounters in each, she must perform named entity recognition (NER). Undaunted by her workload, imagine she decides to identify relations between concepts, such as protein BAD binds protein BAX, text-mining researchers call this information extraction (IE). Along with a group of additional tasks, such as question answering and text summarisation (QA and TS, respectively) which we outline below, problems of computational IR, NER and IE belong to a larger field of natural language processing (NLP)—human language understanding and generation by a computer. NLP is an integral part of artificial intelligence (AI), with its larger goal of recreating or surpassing the computational ability of the human brain. The graduate student in our example has a distinct advantage over the computer, of course—she is naturally gifted, as we all are, with the ability to parse and quickly extract meaning from language. Text mining, a new field that applies computational techniques to the problems faced by our graduate student above, can be thought of as a sub-field of both AI and NLP—but it also stakes a claim for “intellectual independence” with its emphasis on gaining new knowledge.
