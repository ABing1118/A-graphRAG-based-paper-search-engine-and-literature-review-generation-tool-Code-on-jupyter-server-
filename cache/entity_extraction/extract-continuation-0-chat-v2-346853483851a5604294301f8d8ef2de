This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models.

Recently, Attributed Text Generation (ATG) has attracted growing attention, which provides citations to support the model's responses in RAG, so as to enhance the credibility of LLM-generated content and facilitate verification. Prior methods mainly adopt coarse-grained attributions, linking to passage-level references or providing paragraph-level citations. However, these methods still fall short in verifiability and require certain time costs for fact checking. This paper proposes a fine-grained ATG method called ReClaim(Refer&Claim), which alternates the generation of references and answers step by step. Unlike traditional coarse-grained attribution, ReClaim allows the model to add sentence-level fine-grained citations to each answer sentence in long-form question-answering tasks. Our experiments encompass various training and inference methods and multiple LLMs, verifying the effectiveness of our approach.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-01,\n    authors: ['Sirui Xia', 'Xintao Wang', 'Jiaqing Liang', 'Yifei Zhang', 'Weikang Zhou', 'Jiaji Deng', 'Fei Yu', 'Yanghua Xiao'],\n    score: 86.47918433002164\n},\n{\n    title: Tool Calling: Enhancing Medication Consultation via Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Large-scale language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various language\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"RAG and its trajectory in natural language processing\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\"),\n{\n    title: \"RAG and its trajectory in natural language processing\",\n    publicationDate: \"2024-10-03\",\n    authors: [\"Shailja Gupta\", \"Rajesh Ranjan\", \"Surya Narayan Singh\"],\n    score: 86.47918433002164,\n    abstract: \"RAG and its trajectory in natural language processing.\",\n    methodology: \"The paper discusses the evolution of RAG techniques within NLP\",\n    dataset: \"No specific dataset mentioned\",\n    evaluation: \"No explicit evaluation score or method provided\"\n},\n(\"Ground Every Sentence: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LLMs with Interleaved Reference-Claim Generation\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\"),\n{\n    title: \"Ground Every Sentence: Improving Retrieval-Augmented LLMs with Interleaved Reference-Claim Generation\",\n    publicationDate: \"2024-07-01\",\n    authors: [\"Sirui Xia\", \"Xintao Wang\", \"Jiaqing Liang\", \"Yifei Zhang\", \"Weikang Zhou\", \"Jiaji Deng\", \"Fei Yu\", \"Yanghua Xiao\"],\n    score: 86.47918433002164,\n    abstract: \"This paper proposes a fine-grained ATG method called ReClaim(Refer&Claim) which alternates the generation of references and answers step by step.\",\n    methodology: \"The method involves interleaved reference-claim generation to improve RAG\",\n    dataset: \"Experiments encompass various training and inference methods across multiple LLMs\",\n    evaluation: \"Verifies the effectiveness of the approach through experiments\"\n},\n(\"Tool Calling: Enhancing Medication Consultation via Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\"),\n{\n    title: \"Tool Calling: Enhancing Medication Consultation via Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models\",\n    publicationDate: \"No specific date provided\",\n    authors: [\"No explicit author list\"],\n    score: 86.47918433002164,\n    abstract: \"Large-scale language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success across various language\",\n    methodology: \"The paper discusses the enhancement of medication consultation using RAG techniques\",\n    dataset: \"No specific dataset mentioned\",\n    evaluation: \"No explicit evaluation score or method provided\"\n}"}]}
