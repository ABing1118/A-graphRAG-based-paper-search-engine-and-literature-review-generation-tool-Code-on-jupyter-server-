Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: response time, model size, and performance metrics.

Performing comprehensive literature reviews to synthesize knowledge is time-consuming and labor-intensive using manual approaches. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide promising solutions, yet many require coding expertise, limiting accessibility. KNIMEZoBot represents an innovative integration of Zotero, OpenAI, and the KNIME visual programming platform to automate literature review tasks for users with no coding experience. By leveraging KNIME's intuitive graphical interface, researchers can create workflows to search their Zotero libraries and utilize OpenAI models to extract key information without coding. Users simply provide API keys and configure settings through a user-friendly interface in a locally stored copy of the workflow. KNIMEZoBot then allows asking natural language questions via a chatbot and retrieves relevant passages from papers to generate synthesized answers. This system has significant potential to expedite literature reviews for researchers unfamiliar with coding by automating retrieval and analysis of publications in personal Zotero libraries. KNIMEZoBot demonstrates how thoughtfully designed AI tools can expand accessibility and accelerate knowledge building across diverse research domains.,\n    publicationDate: 202\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"response time\", \"performance metric\"),\n(\"model size\", \"performance metric\"),\n(\"standard document retrieval\", \"task\"),\n(\"question-answering tasks\", \"task\"),\n(\"4-bit integer quantization\", \"optimal solution\"),\n(\"practical considerations for CPU inference\", \"optimization factor\"),\n(\"Shanglin Yang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Jialin Zhu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Jialin Wang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xiaohan Xu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Zihang Shao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Liwei Yao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Benchang Zheng\", \"author\"),\n(\"Hu Huang\", \"author\"),\n(\"KNIMEZoBot\", \"system\"),\n(\"Zotero\", \"tool\"),\n(\"OpenAI\", \"tool\"),\n(\"retrieval-Augmented generation\", \"methodology\"),\n(\"academic researchers\", \"target audience\"),\n(\"literature reviews\", \"task\"),\n(\"comprehensive literature review\", \"challenge\"),\n(\"exponentially growing published findings\", \"context\"),\n(\"manual approaches\", \"alternative method\"),\n(\"coding expertise\", \"requirement\"),\n(\"accessibility\", \"benefit\"),\n(\"KNIME's intuitive graphical interface\", \"feature\"),\n(\"workflows\", \"creation tool\"),\n(\"searching Zotero libraries\", \"functionality\"),\n(\"OpenAI models\", \"utilization\"),\n(\"key information extraction\", \"process\"),\n(\"API keys\", \"authentication method\"),\n(\"user-friendly interface\", \"interface characteristic\"),\n(\"locally stored copy of the workflow\", \"workflow storage\"),\n(\"chatbot\", \"interaction mode\"),\n(\"retrieving relevant passages\", \"data retrieval process\"),\n(\"synthesized answers\", \"output generation\"),\n(\"researchers unfamiliar with coding\", \"target user group\"),\n(\"automation of retrieval and analysis\", \"system capability\"),\n(\"personal Zotero libraries\", \"data source\"),\n(\"AI tools\", \"solution category\"),\n(\"expanding accessibility\", \"potential impact\"),\n(\"accelerating knowledge building\", \"goal\"),\n(\"diverse research domains\", \"application scope\")"}]}
