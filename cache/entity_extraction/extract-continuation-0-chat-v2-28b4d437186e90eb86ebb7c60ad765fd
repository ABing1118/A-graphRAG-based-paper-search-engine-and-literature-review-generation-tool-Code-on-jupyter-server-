For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: research represents a significant stride in closing the knowledge gap in patient education and advancing patient-centric healthcare solutions.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-12-24,\n    authors: ['Zonghai Yao', 'Nandyala Siddharth Kantu', 'Guanghao Wei', 'Hieu Tran', 'Zhangqi Duan', 'Sunjae Kwon', 'Zhichao Yang', 'Readme annotation team', 'Hong Yu'],\n    score: 96.87639203842082\n},\n{\n    title: Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: The scaling of inference computation has unlocked the potential of long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings. For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge. However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge. We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations. The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"The scaling of inference computation has unlocked the potential of long-context large language models (LLMs) across diverse settings.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For knowledge-intensive tasks, the increased compute is often allocated to incorporate more external knowledge.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps)\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured?\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"(2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters?\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference\", \"conclusion\"),\n(\"Inference Scaling for Long-Context Retrieval Augmented Generation\", \"subject\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"application context\"),\n(\"long-context large language models (LLMs)\", \"target model type\"),\n(\"in-context learning\", \"scaling strategy\"),\n(\"iterative prompting\", \"scaling strategy\"),\n(\"retrieval augmented generation (RAG)\", \"technique\"),\n(\"performance enhancement\", \"benefit\"),\n(\"optimal test-time compute allocation\", \"optimization goal\"),\n(\"inference scaling laws for RAG\", \"discovered relationship\"),\n(\"computation allocation model\", \"developed tool\"),\n(\"RAG performance estimation\", \"model capability\"),\n(\"various computation constraints\", \"consideration in optimization\"),\n(\"close alignment with experimental results\", \"validation of the model\"),\n(\"optimal configurations application\", \"demonstration of scaling benefits\")"}]}
