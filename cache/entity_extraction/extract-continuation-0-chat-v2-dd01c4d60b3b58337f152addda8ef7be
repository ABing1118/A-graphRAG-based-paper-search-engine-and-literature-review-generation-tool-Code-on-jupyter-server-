This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models. Finally, we discuss key future directions for applying knowledge-graphs-empowered RAG frameworks in networking, including robust updates, mitigation of hallucination, and enhanced security measures for\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Paper\", \"the integration of knowledge graphs into RAG frameworks further enhanced the performance of RAG in networking applications such as Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) and spectrum knowledge maps by providing more contextually relevant responses through more accurate retrieval of related network information.\", \"This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking.\")\n(\"Research Topic\", \"the limitations of conventional RAG\", \"Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction.

However, these models store all learned knowledge (e.g., the appearance of the Eiffel Tower) in the\nmodel parameters, requiring increasingly larger models and training data to capture more knowledge. To integrate knowledge in a more scalable and modular way, we propose a retrievalaugmented multimodal model, which enables a base multimodal model (generator) to refer to relevant knowledge fetched by a retriever from external memory (e.g., multimodal documents on the web). Specifically, we implement a retriever using the pretrained CLIP model and a generator using the CM3 Transformer architecture, and\ntrain this model using the LAION dataset. Our resulting model, named Retrieval-Augmented CM3 (RA-CM3), is the first multimodal model that can retrieve and generate mixtures of text and images.\nWe show that RA-CM3 significantly outperforms baseline multimodal models such as DALL-E and CM3 on both image and caption generation tasks (12 FID and 17 CIDEr improvements on MSCOCO), while requiring much less compute for training (<30% of DALL-E).
