LLMs are highly successful in understanding the subtleties of language and processing context by being trained on large datasets. However, the difficulties encountered in Information Retrieval (IR) processes have created an awareness that these models are not sufficient on their own. Traditional IR methods have generally been insufficient in understanding the complexity of natural language in responding to specific queries and retrieving appropriate information from documents or databases. Since this process is based only on keywords, it cannot fully capture the semantic meaning of the language. For this reason, it has been necessary to go beyond traditional IR methods for more precise information creation based on context and meaning. As a result of these requirements, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has come to the fore. RAG offers the ability to create richer and contextually meaningful answers to user queries by integrating LLMs with information retrieval processes. This architecture allows the language model to instantly access external information sources; thus, it generates more accurate and contextual responses armed with existing information. These features of RAG provide appropriate solutions to users’ information-based demands by better understanding the complexity of natural language. In this study, it is emphasized that the integration of RAG architecture with information retrieval systems and LLMs provides more sensitive and accurate solutions in information-intensive tasks. This study emphasizes that the RAG architecture’s ability to retrieve information by dynamically using the learnings obtained from large datasets of LLMs strengthens applications in the field of NLP.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-06,\n    authors: ['Büşra Tural', 'Zeynep Örpek', 'Zeynep Destan'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: This paper introduces an approach for training o1-like RAG models that retrieve and reason over relevant information step by step before generating the final answer. Conventional RAG methods usually perform a single retrieval step before the generation process, which limits their effectiveness in addressing complex queries due to imperfect retrieval results. In contrast, our proposed method, CoRAG (Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation), allows the model to dynamically reformulate the query based on the evolving state. To train CoRAG effectively, we utilize rejection sampling to automatically generate intermediate retrieval chains, thereby augmenting existing RAG datasets that only provide the correct final answer. At test time, we propose various decoding strategies to scale the model's test-time compute by controlling the length and number of sampled retrieval chains. Experimental results across multiple benchmarks validate the efficacy of CoRAG, particularly in multi-hop question answering tasks, where we observe more than 10 points improvement in EM score compared to strong baselines. On the KILT benchmark, CoRAG establishes a new state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of knowledge-intensive tasks. Furthermore, we offer comprehensive analyses to understand the scaling behavior of CoRAG, laying the groundwork for future research aimed at developing factual and grounded foundation models.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-01-24,\n    authors: ['Liang Wang', 'Haonan Chen', 'Nan Yang', 'Xiaolong Huang', 'Zhicheng Dou', 'Furu Wei'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Unveiling and Consulting Core Experts in Retrieval-Augmented MoE-based LLMs,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) significantly improved the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to solve knowledge-intensive tasks. While existing research seeks to enhance RAG performance by retrieving higher-quality documents or designing RAG-specific LLMs, the internal mechanisms within LLMs that contribute to RAG’s effectiveness remain underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate these internal mechanisms within the popular Mixture-of-Expert (MoE)-based LLMs and demonstrate how to improve RAG by examining expert activations in these LLMs. Our controlled experiments reveal that several core groups of experts are primarily responsible for RAG-related behaviors. The activation of these core experts can signify the model’s inclination towards external/internal knowledge and adjust its behavior. For instance, we identify core experts that can (1) indicate the sufficiency of the model’s internal knowledge, (2) assess the quality of retrieved documents, and (3) enhance the model’s ability to utilize context. Based on these findings, we propose several strategies to enhance RAG’s efficiency and effectiveness through expert activation. Experimental results across various datasets and MoE LLMs show the effectiveness of our method.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-20,\n    authors: ['Xin Zhou', 'Ping Nie', 'Yiwen Guo', 'Haojie\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
