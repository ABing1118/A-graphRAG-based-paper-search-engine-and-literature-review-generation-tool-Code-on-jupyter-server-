Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: can filter retrieved contexts at test time.

However, they still face practical challenges such as hallucinations, difficulty in adapting to new data distributions, and a lack of verifiability. In this position paper, we advocate for retrieval-augmented LMs to replace parametric LMs as the next generation of LMs. By incorporating large-scale datastores during inference, retrieval-augmented LMs can be more reliable, adaptable, and attributable. Despite their potential, retrieval-augmented LMs have yet to be widely adopted due to several obstacles: specifically, current retrieval-augmented LMs struggle to leverage helpful text beyond knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering, have limited interaction between retrieval and LM components, and lack the infrastructure for scaling. To address these, we propose a roadmap for developing general-purpose retrieval-augmented LMs. This involves a reconsideration of datastores and retrievers, the exploration of pipelines with improved retriever-LM interaction, and significant investment in infrastructure for efficient training and inference.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-03-05,\n    authors: ['Akari As\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"FILCO\", \"method\"),\n(\"filter retrieved contexts at test time\", \"functionality\"),\n(\"six knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"tested on\"),\n(\"FLAN-T5 and LLaMa2\", \"used models\"),\n(\"outperforms existing approaches\", \"performance comparison\"),\n(\"extractive question answering (QA)\", \"task type\"),\n(\"complex multi-hop and long-form QA\", \"task type\"),\n(\"fact verification\", \"task type\"),\n(\"dialog generation tasks\", \"task type\"),\n(\"quality of context\", \"improvement focus\"),\n(\"canonical output\", \"comparison reference\"),\n(\"Reliable, Adaptable, and Attributable Language Models with Retrieval\", \"title\"),\n(\"Parametric language models (LMs)\", \"discussed models\"),\n(\"hallucinations\", \"challenge faced\"),\n(\"difficulty in adapting to new data distributions\", \"challenge faced\"),\n(\"lack of verifiability\", \"challenge faced\"),\n(\"retrieval-augmented LMs\", \"proposed solution\"),\n(\"next generation of LMs\", \"position as\"),\n(\"large-scale datastores during inference\", \"enhancement proposed\"),\n(\"more reliable, adaptable, and attributable\", \"desirable qualities\"),\n(\"current retrieval-augmented LMs struggle to leverage helpful text beyond knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering\", \"specific challenge\"),\n(\"limited interaction between retrieval and LM components\", \"specific challenge\"),\n(\"lack of infrastructure for scaling\", \"specific challenge\"),\n(\"roadmap for developing general-purpose retrieval-augmented LMs\", \"proposed solution roadmap\"),\n(\"reconsideration of datastores and retrievers\", \"part of proposed solution\"),\n(\"exploration of pipelines with improved retriever-LM interaction\", \"part of proposed solution\"),\n(\"significant investment in infrastructure for efficient training and inference\", \"part of proposed solution\")"}]}
