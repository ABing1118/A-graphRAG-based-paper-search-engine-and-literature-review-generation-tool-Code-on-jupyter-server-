Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: ', 'Xin Su', 'Man Luo', 'Xiangyu Peng', 'Caiming Xiong', 'Tiep Le', 'Shachar Rosenman', 'Vasudev Lal', 'P.

Tasks that have traditionally been done by specialized NLP models, like entity extraction, summarization, and question answering, can now all be prototyped, usually with high accuracy, using zero-shot or few-shot prompting of LLMs. For example, this allows us to extract highly accurate meta-data, such as up-to-date author and affiliation, for scientific impact analysis from recent scientific papers 1 . The combination of LLMs and Information Retrieval systems has recently evolved into the paradigm of Retrieval Augmented Generation, which is one of the most promising approaches to use LLMs for Question Answering and to reduce hallucination, especially for data sets that were not accessible to LLMs during training, such as private data sources or very recent documents. Retrieval Augmented Generation can even be expanded to large document collections, like full conference proceedings, to quickly create conference summaries, blog-posts or tabular digests. At Zeta Alpha we are building a modern platform for scientific and enterprise knowledge discovery with neural search and generative language models at the core. In this talk, we show how we integrate LLMs with neural search to answer questions, explain documents while reading, summarize large document collections, and generate meta-data on the fly.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Jakub Zavrel'],\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"Xin Su\", \"author\"),\n(\"Man Luo\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xiangyu Peng\", \"author\"),\n(\"Caiming Xiong\", \"author\"),\n(\"Tiep Le\", \"author\"),\n(\"Shachar Rosenman\", \"author\"),\n(\"Vasudev Lal\", \"author\"),\n(\"P.
