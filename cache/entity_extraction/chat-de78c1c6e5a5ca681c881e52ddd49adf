{"result": "(\"DeepSeek LLM: Scaling Open-Source Language Models with Longtermism\")\n\nThis paper discusses the scaling of open-source large language models (LLMs), focusing on two configurations, 7B and 67B. The authors present their findings that help in scaling large-scale models using established scaling laws. They introduce DeepSeek LLM, a project aimed at advancing open-source language models with a long-term perspective.\n\nTo support the pre-training phase of DeepSeek LLM, they have developed a dataset consisting of 2 trillion tokens and continuously expanding it. The paper also discusses supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models to create DeepSeek Chat models.\n\nThe evaluation results show that DeepSeek LLM 67B outperforms LLaMA-2 70B across various benchmarks, particularly in code, mathematics, and reasoning tasks. In open-ended evaluations, DeepSeek LLM 67B Chat is found to perform better than GPT-3.5.\n\nThe paper was published on January 5, 2024, by a team of authors including DeepSeek-AI Xiao Bi, Deli Chen, Guanting Chen, Shanhuang Chen, Damai Dai, C.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The technique combines elements from vector databases and knowledge graphs to enhance both the retrieval accuracy and answer generation quality in question-answering tasks, particularly within financial domains. It demonstrates that by integrating context from both vector databases and knowledge graphs, it outperforms traditional methods like VectorRAG (which relies solely on vector databases) and GraphRAG (which uses knowledge graphs alone). The authors show improvements across retrieval accuracy and answer generation metrics.\n\n**Document 2**: This document is about the Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns conference held in Versailles, France.

Models with Longtermism,\n    abstract: The rapid development of open-source large language models (LLMs) has been truly remarkable. However, the scaling law described in previous literature presents varying conclusions, which casts a dark cloud over scaling LLMs. We delve into the study of scaling laws and present our distinctive findings that facilitate scaling of large scale models in two commonly used open-source configurations, 7B and 67B. Guided by the scaling laws, we introduce DeepSeek LLM, a project dedicated to advancing open-source language models with a long-term perspective. To support the pre-training phase, we have developed a dataset that currently consists of 2 trillion tokens and is continuously expanding. We further conduct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on DeepSeek LLM Base models, resulting in the creation of DeepSeek Chat models. Our evaluation results demonstrate that DeepSeek LLM 67B surpasses LLaMA-2 70B on various benchmarks, particularly in the domains of code, mathematics, and reasoning. Furthermore, open-ended evaluations reveal that DeepSeek LLM 67B Chat exhibits superior performance compared to GPT-3.5.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-01-05,\n    authors: ['DeepSeek-AI Xiao Bi', 'Deli Chen', 'Guanting Chen', 'Shanhuang Chen', 'Damai Dai', 'C.
