While GraphRAG has demonstrated success across domains, its security implications remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, this work examines GraphRAG's vulnerability to poisoning attacks, uncovering an intriguing security paradox: compared to conventional RAG, GraphRAG's graph-based indexing and retrieval enhance resilience against simple poisoning attacks; meanwhile, the same features also create new attack surfaces. We present GRAGPoison, a novel attack that exploits shared relations in the knowledge graph to craft poisoning text capable of compromising multiple queries simultaneously. GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text).
