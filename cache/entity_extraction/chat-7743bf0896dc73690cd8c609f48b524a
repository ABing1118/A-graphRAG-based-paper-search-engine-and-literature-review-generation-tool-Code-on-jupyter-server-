{"result": "The text discusses the issue of models generating outputs based on retrieved passages that may not be relevant to an input query, leading to potential learning of incorrect patterns or memorization. To address this problem, a new method is introduced which incorporates the concept of 'evidentiality' into training the generator model. Evidentiality refers to whether each passage contains correct evidence to support the output.\n\nThe proposed solution involves using multi-task learning where the model not only generates the final output but also predicts the evidentiality of each retrieved passage. This helps in ensuring that only passages with relevant and accurate information are used for generating the output, thereby reducing the risk of spurious cues or memorization.\n\nAdditionally, a task-agnostic method is introduced to obtain high-quality silver evidentiality labels when gold (correct) labels are not available in most domains. Silver labels are less precise than gold labels but can still provide useful information for training purposes.\n\nThe effectiveness of this new approach is demonstrated through experiments on five datasets across three knowledge-intensive tasks, showing significant improvements over the baseline model that does not consider evidentiality. The results indicate that multi-task learning and silver evidentiality mining play crucial roles in enhancing the performance of the generator model.\n\nThe paper was published at the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) conference in 2021, with citations from other research papers indicating its impact on the field. The authors are Akari Asai, Matt Gardner, and Hannaneh Hajishirzi. The code for this work is available on GitHub at <https://github.com/AkariAsai/evidentiality_qa>.\n\nThe paper also mentions that large language models (LLMs) face challenges when dealing with domain-specific tasks due to issues like hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Fine-tuning these models for specific domains can be costly in terms of time and resources.\n\nTo improve the performance of LLMs on such tasks, a method called retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been proposed. This involves referencing model responses to a predefined ontology or knowledge base. The paper introduces SMART-SLIC, a domain-specific framework that combines RAG with Knowledge Graphs (KGs) and vector stores (VSs). These components store factual information specific to the domain.\n\nTo avoid potential issues like hallucinations in KGs, which can occur when models generate incorrect facts, the authors build these domain-specific KGs and VSs using NLP techniques, data mining methods, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. This ensures that only accurate and relevant information is used for generating outputs.\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a novel approach to enhance the performance of large language models on knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating evidentiality into training and utilizing domain-specific resources like Knowledge Graphs and vector stores. The proposed method aims to improve accuracy, reduce hallucinations, and provide better attribution of knowledge in model-generated responses.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.\nNext, report all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge. We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate R\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"relationship\"<|>external knowledge<|>RAG<|>Utilizing external knowledge can enhance performance in retrieval augmented generation (RAG)<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>in-context learning<|>RAG<|>In-context learning provides additional flexibility to scale test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iterative prompting<|>RAG<|>Iterative prompting offers another strategy beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge in scaling inference for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>retrieved documents<|>RAG<|>Increasing retrieved documents can enhance LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information during test-time computation<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>generation steps<|>RAG<|>Increasing generation steps provides additional flexibility in scaling test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>optimal configuration<|>RAG performance<|>The scaling of inference computation benefits RAG performance when optimally configured<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>budget allocation<|>optimal test-time compute<|>We can predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>nearly linear gains<|>inference scaling laws<|>Increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, describing the inference scaling laws for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>computation allocation model<|>RAG<|>We develop a computation allocation model to estimate RAG's performance based on different inference parameters and budget allocations<|>2)\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\ntext:\n\",\n    \"score\": 94.1415686865115\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"title\": \"Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by sourcing factual information from external databases, which is extensively employed in document-grounded question-answering (QA) tasks.

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection.
