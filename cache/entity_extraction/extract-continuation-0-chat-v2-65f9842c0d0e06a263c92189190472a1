We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: are not Zero-Shot Reasoners for Biomedical Information Extraction,\n    abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration. To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora. Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain. Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required. This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-22,\n    authors: ['Aishik Nagar', 'Viktor Schlegel', 'Thanh-Tung Nguyen', 'Hao Li', 'Yuping Wu', 'Kuluhan Binici', 'Stefan Winkler'],\n    score: 80.\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"are not Zero-Shot Reasoners for Biomedical Information Extraction\", \"title\"),\n(\"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extraction.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed and Wikipedia corpora.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Counter-intuitively, our results reveal that standard prompting consistently outperforms more complex techniques across both tasks, laying bare the limitations in the current application of CoT, self-consistency and RAG in the biomedical domain.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our findings suggest that advanced prompting methods developed for knowledge- or reasoning-intensive tasks, such as CoT or RAG, are not easily portable to biomedical tasks where precise structured outputs are required.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"This highlights the need for more effective integration of external knowledge and reasoning mechanisms in LLMs to enhance their performance in real-world biomedical applications.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Aishik Nagar\", \"author\"),\n(\"Viktor Schlegel\", \"author\"),\n(\"Thanh-Tung Nguyen\", \"author\"),\n(\"Hao Li\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yuping Wu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Kuluhan Binici\", \"author\"),\n(\"Stefan Winkler\", \"author\"),\n(\"2024-08-22\", \"publicationDate\"),\n(\"80\", \"score\")"}]}
