Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.

However, the standard RAG approach fails to fully leverage the information within the retrieved documents, which can lead to incorrect response generation. While advanced RAG approaches empower LLMs to understand the correlation between queries and documents, they require costly annotation. In this work, we propose a strategy to help LLMs better leverage the information within retrieved documents in RAG system while reducing data acquisition costs. We fine-tuned an LLM on a dataset comprising queries, retrieved documents, and their relevance scores generated by a pre-trained biomedical re-ranker to adapt the model for answering questions from reference documents. The fine-tuned model can independently score retrieved documents before answering the question, thereby more effectively utilizing the information contained within retrieved documents. Experimental results shows that we have improved the model’s accuracy on two biomedical benchmarks while reduced the costs of data acquisition.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-03,\n    authors: ['Yinkui Huang', 'Tianrun Gao', 'Jiangjiang Zhang', 'Xiaohong Liu', 'Guangyu Wang'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: ChatTf: A Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Intelligent Q&A System for Mitigating Factuality Hallucinations in Traditional Folklore,\n    abstract: Large language models are rapidly advancing the field of artificial intelligence, with current research focusing primarily on traditional natural language understanding tasks, such as question answering and information extraction.
