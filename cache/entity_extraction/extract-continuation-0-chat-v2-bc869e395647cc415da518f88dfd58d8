We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-15,\n    authors: ['Jinming Nian', 'Zhiyuan Peng', 'Qifan Wang', 'Yi Fang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: ClimRetrieve: A Benchmarking Dataset for Information Retrieval from Corporate Climate Disclosures,\n    abstract: To handle the vast amounts of qualitative data produced in corporate climate communication, stakeholders increasingly rely on Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. However, a significant gap remains in evaluating domain-specific information retrieval – the basis for answer generation. To address this challenge, this work simulates the typical tasks of a sustainability analyst by examining 30 sustainability reports with 16 detailed climate-related questions. As a result, we obtain a dataset with over 8.5K unique question-source-answer pairs labeled by different levels of relevance. Furthermore, we develop a use case with the dataset to investigate the integration of expert knowledge into information retrieval with embeddings. Although we show that incorporating expert knowledge works, we also outline the critical limitations of embeddings in knowledge-intensive downstream domains like climate change communication.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-14,\n    authors: ['Tobias Schimanski', 'Jingwei Ni', 'Roberto Spacey', 'Nicola Ranger', 'Markus Leippold'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Intermediate Distillation: Data-Efficient Distillation from Black-Box LLMs for Information Retrieval,\n    abstract: Recent research has explored distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to optimize retriever models, especially within the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. However, most existing training methods rely on extracting supervision signals from LLMs' weights or their output probabilities, which is not only resource-intensive but also incompatible with black-box LLMs. In this paper, we introduce \\textit{Intermediate Distillation}, a data-efficient knowledge distillation training scheme that treats LLMs as black boxes and distills their knowledge via an innovative LLM-ranker-retriever pipeline, solely using LLMs' ranking generation as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of retriever models with only 1,000 training instances. Moreover, our distilled retriever model significantly boosts performance in question-answering tasks within the RAG framework, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to economically and effectively train smaller models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-18,\n    authors: ['Zizhong Li', 'Haopeng Zhang', 'Jiawei Zhang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking to Improve Factualness in Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, yet they often struggle with maintaining factual accuracy, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains like healthcare. This study introduces LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking, a novel approach designed to enhance the factual reliability of LLMs, with a focus on medical question answering (QA). LEAF utilizes a dual strategy to enhance the factual accuracy of responses from models such as Llama 3 70B Instruct and Llama 3 8B Instruct. The first strategy, Fact-Check-Then-RAG, improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating fact-checking results to guide the retrieval process without updating model parameters. The second strategy, Learning from Fact-Checks via Self-Training, involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fact-checked responses or applying Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) with fact-checking as a ranking mechanism, both updating LLM parameters from supervision. These findings suggest that integrating fact-checked responses whether through RAG enhancement or self-training enhances the reliability and factual correctness of LLM outputs, offering a promising solution for applications where information accuracy is crucial.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-31,\n    authors: ['Hieu Tran', 'Junda Wang', 'Yujan Ting', 'Weijing Huang', 'Terrence Chen'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Can Open-Source LLMs Compete with Commercial Models?
