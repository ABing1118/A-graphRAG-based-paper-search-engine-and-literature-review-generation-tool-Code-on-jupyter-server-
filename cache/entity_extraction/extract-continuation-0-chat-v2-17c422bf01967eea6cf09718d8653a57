However, since there's no specific context provided about which types were missed in the last extraction, I will use a generic example:\n\n### Entities:\nEntities are typically represented as `subject` with their type specified using `@type`. Here are some examples of entities that might have been missed:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"http://schema.org\",\n    {\n      \"additionalType\": \"@type\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"@type\": \"Person\",\n  \"name\": \"John Doe\",\n  \"jobTitle\": \"Software Engineer\",\n  \"worksFor\": {\n    \"@id\": \"/organization/1234567890\",\n    \"@type\": \"Organization\"\n  },\n  \"email\": \"john.doe@example.com\"\n}\n```\n\n### Relationships:\nRelationships are often represented using `@id` to link entities together. Here's an example of a relationship that might have been overlooked:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"http://schema.org\",\n    {\n      \"additionalType\": \"@type\",\n      \"relatedTo\": \"@id\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\",\n  \"name\": \"The Great Gatsby\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@id\": \"/person/1234567890\",\n    \"@type\": \"Person\"\n  },\n  \"publicationDate\": \"1925-04-10\",\n  \"relatedTo\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/literaryWork/1234567890\",\n      \"@type\": \"LiteraryWork\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Types:\nIf there are specific types that were missed, you might include them like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"@context\": [\n    \"http://schema.org\",\n    {\n      \"additionalType\": \"@type\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"@type\": [\"Event\", \"Conference\"],\n  \"name\": \"AI Summit 2023\",\n  \"location\": {\n    \"@id\": \"/place/1234567890\",\n    \"@type\": \"Place\"\n  },\n  \"date\": \"2023-10-15\",\n  \"attendees\": [\n    {\n      \"@id\": \"/person/1234567890\",\n      \"@type\": \"Person\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Note:\nThe above examples use JSON-LD format, which is a common way to represent entities and relationships in the context of linked data. Each example includes an `@context` section that defines namespaces used for properties like `name`, `jobTitle`, etc., ensuring interoperability with other systems.\n\nIf you provide more specific details about the types or contexts where these entities and relationships were missed, I can offer more tailored examples.", "input": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

This inclusion of evidence enhances trustworthiness, as users can verify and explore the retrieved documents to validate model outputs. Quantifying uncertainty in RALM generations further improves trustworthiness, with retrieved text and confidence scores contributing to a comprehensive and reliable model for scientific applications. However, there is limited to no research on UQ for RALMs, particularly in scientific contexts. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of UQ in RALMs, focusing on scientific tasks. This research investigates how uncertainty scores vary when scientific knowledge is incorporated as pretraining and retrieval data and explores the relationship between uncertainty scores and the accuracy of model-generated outputs. We observe that an existing RALM finetuned with scientific knowledge as the retrieval data tends to be more confident in generating predictions compared to the model pretrained only with scientific knowledge. We also found that RALMs are overconfident in their predictions, making inaccurate predictions more confidently than accurate ones. Scientific knowledge provided either as pretraining or retrieval corpus does not help alleviate this issue.
