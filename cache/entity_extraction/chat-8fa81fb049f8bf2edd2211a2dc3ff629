Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5.

Collections of aggadic midrash from late antiquity (e.g., the Midrash Rabbah) or the Middle Ages (e.g., Yalqut Shim‘oni) are a digest of a multitude of homilies on biblical fragments of texts, developing several often alternative ideas and subnarratives.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

Thus, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Building a virtual data centre for the biological, ecological and environmental sciences 33 while multiple definitions exist, text mining is typically associated with information retrieval, extraction, and synthesis, with a special stress on gaining new knowledge. Moving beyond information retrieval and extraction, some proportion of published assertions can be repackaged to form synthetic ideas, that is, new compound concepts that are significantly more valuable to the scientific community than the sum of their original assertions. In 1986, researcher Don R. Swanson read a collection of scientific articles that spanned different fields of inquiry. Each of these disconnected communities had information valuable to the other, but due to the lack of crosstalk, did not appear to know it. Swanson noticed, in papers produced by researchers interested in Raynaud’s disease, that its symptoms often included increased blood viscosity and rigidity of erythrocytes. Meanwhile, in the nutrition biology community several publications proposed that dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity, without explicitly connecting this finding to Raynaud’s disease. In this early real-world example of synthetic idea generation, Swanson merged these findings to suggest that fish oil can be beneficial for Raynaud’s patients and published his suggestion as a medical hypothesis. The hypothesis was confirmed some years later in an independent randomised clinical trial. Even with current text mining capabilities, such synthetic ideas can be discovered automatically. A more distant but nonetheless realistic aim of the field is to trace and map more sophisticated ideas (idea isomorphisms) that are expressed differently in different scientific fields, yet represent identical problems or their solutions. Were such idea mappings made instantly available through an Internet interface, the result could be truly impressive. The diffusion of innovations across science could be markedly increased by making solutions developed in one area visible to specialists still desperately searching for them in a different field. Computationally pairing problems and solutions generated by different fields is a type of automated creativity (systematic search for synthetic ideas) that computers almost certainly will do for us in the not too distant future.

Addressing the Earth’s environmental problems requires that we change the ways that we do science; harness the enormity of existing data; develop new methods to combine, analyse, and visualise diverse data resources; create new, long-lasting cyberinfrastructure; and re-envision many of our longstanding institutions. DataONE (Observation Network for Earth) represents a new virtual organisation whose goal is to enable new science and knowledge creation through universal access to data about life on earth and the environment that sustains it. DataONE is designed to be the foundation for new innovative environmental science through a distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure that meets the needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, DataONE will ensure the preservation and access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national science data. DataONE is transdisciplinary, making biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; making environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; providing secure and long-term preservation and access; and engaging scientists, land-managers, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Curated databases 34 policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualisations. Most importantly, DataONE will serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network. DataONE is a five-year project that began in 2009. I identify key environmental scientific, cyberinfrastructure, and sociocultural challenges and provides a road map for how DataONE is addressing these challenges. Specific examples are based on a DataONE EVA (Exploration, Visualisation and Analysis) Working Group effort to create an integrated database that can be used for better understanding the ecology of bird migrations. The important message is that to succeed in international preservation and access to data we need to recognise the importance of data from the perspective of the scientists to understand the requirements. Scientists want fast access in terms of data and tool discovery, automated/automatic metadata annotation and rapid analysis via appropriate visualisation. They want easy access in terms of data and metadata upload; integrated, linked, and synthesised databases\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
