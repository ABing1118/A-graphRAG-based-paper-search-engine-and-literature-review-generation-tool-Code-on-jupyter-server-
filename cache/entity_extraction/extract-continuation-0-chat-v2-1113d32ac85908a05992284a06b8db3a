Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: in dialogue can be improved using the question answering model.

However, running retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) is slow and difficult to scale due to processing large amounts of retrieved text. We introduce binary token representations (BTR), which use 1-bit vectors to precompute every token in passages, significantly reducing computation during inference. Despite the potential loss of accuracy, our new calibration techniques and training objectives restore performance. Combined with offline and runtime compression, this only requires 127GB of disk space for encoding 3 billion tokens in Wikipedia. Our experiments show that on five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, BTR accelerates state-of-the-art inference by up to 4x and reduces storage by over 100x while maintaining over 95% task performance.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-10-02,\n    authors: ['Qingqing Cao', 'Sewon Min', 'Yizhong Wang', 'Hannaneh Hajishirzi'],\n    score: 96.87639203842082\n},\n{\n    title: Empirical evaluation of Uncertainty Quantification in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Science,\n    abstract: Large language models (\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"BTR: Binary Token Representations for Efficient Retrieval Augmented Language Models\", \"title\"),\n(\"Retrieval augmentation addresses many critical problems in large language models such as hallucination, staleness, and privacy leaks.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"However, running retrieval-augmented language models (LMs) is slow and difficult to scale due to processing large amounts of retrieved text.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce binary token representations (BTR), which use 1-bit vectors to precompute every token in passages, significantly reducing computation during inference.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Despite the potential loss of accuracy, our new calibration techniques and training objectives restore performance.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Combined with offline and runtime compression, this only requires 127GB of disk space for encoding 3 billion tokens in Wikipedia.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our experiments show that on five knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, BTR accelerates state-of-the-art inference by up to 4x and reduces storage by over 100x while maintaining over 95% task performance.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Empirical evaluation of Uncertainty Quantification in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models for Science\", \"title\"),\n(\"Large language models\", \"context\"),\n(\"Uncertainty Quantification\", \"evaluation technique\"),\n(\"Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\", \"focus area\"),\n(\"Science NLP tasks\", \"application domain\"),\n(\"hallucination, staleness, and privacy leaks\", \"problems addressed by retrieval augmentation\"),\n(\"1-bit vectors\", \"BTR component\"),\n(\"offline and runtime compression\", \"additional techniques\"),\n(\"3 billion tokens in Wikipedia\", \"encoding capacity\"),\n(\"4x inference acceleration\", \"performance improvement metric\"),\n(\"over 100x storage reduction\", \"storage efficiency enhancement\"),\n(\"95% task performance maintenance\", \"accuracy preservation indicator\")"}]}
