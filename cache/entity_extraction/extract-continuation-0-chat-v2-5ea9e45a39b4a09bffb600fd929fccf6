We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: LMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems.

However, contemporary RAG approaches suffer from irrelevant knowledge retrieval issues in complex domain questions (e.g., HotPot QA) due to the lack of corresponding domain knowledge, leading to low-quality generations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, DuetRAG. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously integrate the domain fintuning and RAG models to improve the knowledge retrieval quality, thereby enhancing generation quality. Finally, we demonstrate DuetRAG' s matches with expert human researchers on HotPot QA.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-12,\n    authors: ['Dian Jiao', 'Li Cai', 'Jingsheng Huang', 'Wenqiao Zhang', 'Siliang Tang', 'Yueting Zhuang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Evaluating Self-Generated Documents for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models,\n    abstract: The integration of documents generated by LLMs themselves (Self-Docs) alongside retrieved documents has emerged as a promising strategy for retrieval-augmented generation systems. However, previous research primarily focuses on optimizing the use of Self-Docs, with their inherent properties remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we first investigate the overall effectiveness of Self-Docs, identifying key factors that shape their contribution to RAG performance (RQ1). Building on these insights, we develop a taxonomy grounded in Systemic Functional Linguistics to compare the influence of various Self-Docs categories (RQ2) and explore strategies for combining them with external sources (RQ3). Our findings reveal which types of Self-Docs are most beneficial and offer practical guidelines for leveraging them to achieve significant improvements in knowledge-intensive question answering tasks.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-17,\n    authors: ['Jiatao Li', 'Xinyu Hu', 'Xunjian Yin', 'Xiaojun Wan'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Synchronous Faithfulness Monitoring for Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have shown strong performance and wide applicability in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, there are significant trustworthiness concerns as RALMs are prone to generating unfaithful outputs, including baseless information or contradictions with the retrieved context. This paper proposes SynCheck, a lightweight monitor that leverages fine-grained decoding dynamics including sequence likelihood, uncertainty quantification, context influence, and semantic alignment to synchronously detect unfaithful sentences. By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search for long-form retrieval-augmented generation. Empirical results demonstrate that FOD outperforms traditional strategies such as abstention, reranking, or contrastive decoding significantly in terms of faithfulness, achieving over 10% improvement across six datasets.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-19,\n    authors: ['Di Wu', 'Jia-Chen Gu', 'Fan Yin', 'Nanyun Peng', 'Kai-Wei Chang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: E2E-AFG: An End-to-End Model with Adaptive Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of large language models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model with adaptive filtering for retrieval-augmented generation (E2E-AFG), which integrates answer existence judgment and text generation into a single end-to-end framework. This enables the model to focus more effectively on relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and generating accurate answers.
