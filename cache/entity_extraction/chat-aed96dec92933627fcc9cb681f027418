Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to address this issue by integrating external knowledge, enhancing the factual accuracy of outputs. However, naive RAG encounters challenges in effectively utilizing retrieved content, particularly in specialized domains like biomedicine. LLMs often struggle to integrate retrieved content as irrelevant information can interfere with the model’s judgment. Even if relevant documents are retrieved, the model may be unable to accurately comprehend and utilize the domain-specific features due to its inherent knowledge limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Document Embeddings Enhanced Biomedical RAG (DEEB-RAG), a framework that incorporates document embeddings along with the original retrieved text. DEEB-RAG uses MedCPT to generate document embeddings and these embeddings are then aligned with the LLM’s semantic space using a two-stage training process on a simple projector. Experimental results on biomedical QA datasets show that DEEB-RAG improves accuracy, with an average performance increase of 2.3% over naive RAG. This demonstrates DEEB-RAG’s ability to mitigate the challenges of utilizing complex biomedical information, thereby enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in biomedical domain.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-03,\n    authors: ['Yongle Kong', 'Zhihao Yang', 'Ling Luo',\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
