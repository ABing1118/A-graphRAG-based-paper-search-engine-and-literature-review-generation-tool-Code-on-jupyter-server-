However, traditional retrieval modules often rely on large document index and disconnect with generative tasks. With the advent of generative retrieval (GR), language models can retrieve by directly generating document identifiers (DocIDs), offering superior performance in retrieval tasks. However, the potential relationship between GR and downstream tasks remains unexplored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{CorpusLM}, a unified language model that leverages external corpus to tackle various knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating generative retrieval, closed-book generation, and RAG through a unified greedy decoding process. We design the following mechanisms to facilitate effective retrieval and generation, and improve the end-to-end effectiveness of KI tasks: (1) We develop a ranking-oriented DocID list generation strategy, which refines GR by directly learning from a DocID ranking list, to improve retrieval quality. (2) We design a continuous DocIDs-References-Answer generation strategy, which facilitates effective and efficient RAG. (3) We employ well-designed unsupervised DocID understanding tasks, to comprehend DocID semantics and their relevance to downstream tasks. We evaluate our approach on the widely used KILT benchmark with two variants of backbone models, i.e., T5 and Llama2. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our models in both retrieval and downstream tasks.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-02-02,\n    authors: ['Xiaoxi Li', 'Zhicheng Dou', 'Yujia Zhou', 'Fangchao Liu'],\n    score: 107.19162312519754\n},\n{\n    title: Telecom Language Models: Must They Be Large?,\n    abstract: The increasing interest in Large Language Models (LLMs) within the telecommunications sector underscores their potential to revolutionize operational efficiency. However, the deployment of these sophisticated models is often hampered by their substantial size and computational demands, raising concerns about their viability in resource-constrained environments. Addressing this challenge, recent advancements have seen the emergence of small language models that surprisingly exhibit performance comparable to their larger counterparts in many tasks, such as coding and common-sense reasoning. Phi-2, a compact yet powerful model, exemplifies this new wave of efficient small language models. This paper conducts a comprehensive evaluation of Phi-2’s intrinsic understanding of the telecommunications domain. Recognizing the scale-related limitations, we enhance Phi-2’s capabilities through a Retrieval-Augmented Generation approach, meticulously integrating an extensive knowledge base specifically curated with telecom standard specifications. The enhanced Phi-2 model demonstrates a profound improvement in accuracy, answering questions about telecom standards with a precision that closely rivals the more resource-intensive GPT-3.5. The paper further explores the refined capabilities of Phi-2 in addressing problem-solving scenarios within the telecom sector, highlighting its potentials and limitations.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-03-07,\n    authors: ['Nicola Piovesan', 'Antonio De Domenico', 'Fadhel Ayed'],\n    score: 107.19162312519754\n},\n{\n    title: Multi-Task Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation with Relevance Sampling,\n    abstract: This paper studies multi-task training of retrieval-augmented generation models for knowledge-intensive tasks. We propose to clean the training set by utilizing a distinct property of knowledge-intensive generation: The connection of query-answer pairs to items in the knowledge base. We filter training examples via a threshold of confidence on the relevance labels, whether a pair is answerable by the knowledge base or not. We train a single Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) generator on seven combined tasks of the KILT benchmark. The experimental results suggest that our simple yet effective approach substantially improves competitive baselines on two strongly imbalanced tasks; and shows either smaller improvements or no significant regression on the remaining tasks. Furthermore, we demonstrate our multi-task training with relevance label sampling scales well with increased model capacity and achieves state-of-the-art results in five out of seven KILT tasks.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-07-07,\n    authors: ['Sebastian Hofstätter', 'Jiecao Chen', 'K.
