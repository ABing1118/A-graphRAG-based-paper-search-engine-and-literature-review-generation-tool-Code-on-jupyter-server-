We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: BI) show that GeneRAG outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with a 39% improvement in answering gene questions, a 43% performance increase in cell type annotation, and a 0.25 decrease in error rates for gene interaction prediction.

However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such as contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at achieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for constructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various error types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data ratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"GeneRAG\", \"title\"),\n(\"GPT-3.5\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"GPT-4\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"39% improvement in answering gene questions\", \"performance on specific task\"),\n(\"43% performance increase in cell type annotation\", \"additional performance on another task\"),\n(\"0.25 decrease in error rates for gene interaction prediction\", \"improvement in yet another task\"),\n(\"GeneRAG’s potential to bridge a critical gap in LLM capabilities\", \"potential application\"),\n(\"more effective applications in genetics\", \"targeted field of improvement\"),\n(\"Xinyi Lin\", \"author\"),\n(\"Gelei Deng\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yuekang Li\", \"author\"),\n(\"Jingquan Ge\", \"author\"),\n(\"Joshua Wing Kei Ho\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yi Liu\", \"author\"),\n(\"80.39720770839918\", \"score\"),\n(\"KnowPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\", \"title\"),\n(\"Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy\", \"proposed strategy\"),\n(\"KnowPO\", \"strategy name\"),\n(\"enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs\", \"goal of proposed strategy\"),\n(\"instruction-tuning\", \"previous research focus\"),\n(\"contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion\", \"undesirable behaviors\"),\n(\"knowledge conflicts may arise\", \"issue in integrating external knowledge\"),\n(\"avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods\", \"approach to address issues\"),\n(\"constructing knowledge conflict datasets\", \"method for comprehensive coverage of error types\"),\n(\"rewriting strategy\", \"additional proposed solution\"),\n(\"data ratio optimization strategy\", \"strategy to address preference imbalances\")"}]}
