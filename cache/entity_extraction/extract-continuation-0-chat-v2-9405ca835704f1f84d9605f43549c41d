This paper presents the development of an innovative platform designed to enhance safety, operational efficiency, and automation in fully mechanized coal mining in China. This platform integrates cloud edge computing, real-time data processing, and AI-driven analytics to improve decision-making and maintenance strategies. Several AI models have been developed for the proactive maintenance of comprehensive mining face equipment, including early warnings for periodic weighting and the detection of common faults such as those in the shearer, hydraulic support, and conveyor. The platform leverages large-scale knowledge graph models and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) technology to build structured knowledge graphs.
