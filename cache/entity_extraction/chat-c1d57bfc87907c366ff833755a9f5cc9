Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.

This is a data intensive process; a high-power microscope can easily generate several terabytes of data each day. Tissue characterisation involves workflows that employ a sequence of steps: image segmentation, feature construction, feature selection, feature extraction, classification of features, and annotation of images and image regions. The sheer size of image datasets makes gleaning information from digital microscopy slides a data-intensive process requiring efficient system support. The large number of potentially useful micro-anatomic features and the large number of image preprocessing algorithms makes it essential to develop effective semantically oriented mechanisms to manage, query and curate features and to track provenance associated with the generation of each collection of features.

Imagine that a graduate student enters the Library of Congress with an assignment: she is to find and pull all texts relevant to protein glycosylation. Her problem is straightforward, known among text-miners as information retrieval (IR). If the student must not only find the books, but also to flag the most important concepts she encounters in each, she must perform named entity recognition (NER). Undaunted by her workload, imagine she decides to identify relations between concepts, such as protein BAD binds protein BAX, text-mining researchers call this information extraction (IE). Along with a group of additional tasks, such as question answering and text summarisation (QA and TS, respectively) which we outline below, problems of computational IR, NER and IE belong to a larger field of natural language processing (NLP)—human language\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
