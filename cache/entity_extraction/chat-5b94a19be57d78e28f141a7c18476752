This study underscores the potential of LLMs to streamline KG creation and enhance GraphRAG accessibility for real-world applications, while setting a foundation for future advancements.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-10,\n    authors: ['Ahan Bhatt', 'Nandan Vaghela', 'Kush Dudhia'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Development of an Intelligent Coal Production and Operation Platform Based on a Real-Time Data Warehouse and AI Model,\n    abstract: Smart mining solutions currently suffer from inadequate big data support and insufficient AI applications. The main reason for these limitations is the absence of a comprehensive industrial internet cloud platform tailored for the coal industry, which restricts resource integration. This paper presents the development of an innovative platform designed to enhance safety, operational efficiency, and automation in fully mechanized coal mining in China. This platform integrates cloud edge computing, real-time data processing, and AI-driven analytics to improve decision-making and maintenance strategies. Several AI models have been developed for the proactive maintenance of comprehensive mining face equipment, including early warnings for periodic weighting and the detection of common faults such as those in the shearer, hydraulic support, and conveyor. The platform leverages large-scale knowledge graph models and Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG) technology to build structured knowledge graphs. This facilitates intelligent Q&A capabilities and precise fault diagnosis, thereby enhancing system responsiveness and improving the accuracy of fault resolution. The practical process of implementing such a platform primarily based on open-source components is summarized in this paper.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-19,\n    authors: ['Yongtao\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
