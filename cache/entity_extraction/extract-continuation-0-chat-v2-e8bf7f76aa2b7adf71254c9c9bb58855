The relationships specify how entities are connected or interact.\n\nIf you have a specific set of types or context in mind for the extraction, please provide more details so I can tailor these examples accordingly.", "input": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

Identify and extract all the entities that match the types above. For each identified entity, gather:\n   - entity_name: The exact text of the entity, capitalized if it’s a title or a name.\n   - entity_type: Must be one of [paper_title, author, publication_date, abstract].\n   - entity_description: A concise description of the entity’s role or content.\n   Format for each identified entity:\n   (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.
