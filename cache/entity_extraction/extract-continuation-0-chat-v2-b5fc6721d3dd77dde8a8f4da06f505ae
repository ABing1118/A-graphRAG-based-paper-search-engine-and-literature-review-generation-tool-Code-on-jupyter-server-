Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: answering the question.

LLMs are highly successful in understanding the subtleties of language and processing context by being trained on large datasets. However, the difficulties encountered in Information Retrieval (IR) processes have created an awareness that these models are not sufficient on their own. Traditional IR methods have generally been insufficient in understanding the complexity of natural language in responding to specific queries and retrieving appropriate information from documents or databases. Since this process is based only on keywords, it cannot fully capture the semantic meaning of the language. For this reason, it has been necessary to go beyond traditional IR methods for more precise information creation based on context and meaning. As a result of these requirements, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has come to the fore. RAG offers the ability to create richer and contextually meaningful answers to user queries by integrating LLMs with information retrieval processes. This architecture allows the language model to instantly access external information sources; thus, it generates more accurate and contextual responses armed with existing information. These features of RAG provide appropriate solutions to users’ information-based demands by better understanding the complexity of natural language. In this study, it is emphasized that the integration of RAG architecture with information retrieval systems and LLMs provides more\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"ActiveRAG\", \"title\"),\n(\"All data and codes are available at https://github.com/OpenMatch/ActiveRAG.\", \"publication details\"),\n(\"2024-02-21\", \"publication date\"),\n(\"Zhipeng Xu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Zhenghao Liu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yukun Yan\", \"author\"),\n(\"Shuo Wang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Shi Yu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Zheni Zeng\", \"author\"),\n(\"Chaojun Xiao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Zhiyuan Liu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Ge Yu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Chenyan Xiong\", \"author\"),\n(\"70\", \"score\"),\n(\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM Integration\", \"title\"),\n(\"Advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) have led to the emergence of complex structures such as Large Language Models (LLM).\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"LLMs are highly successful in understanding the subtleties of language and processing context by being trained on large datasets.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"However, the difficulties encountered in Information Retrieval (IR) processes have created an awareness that these models are not sufficient on their own.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Traditional IR methods have generally been insufficient in understanding the complexity of natural language in responding to specific queries and retrieving appropriate information from documents or databases.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Since this process is based only on keywords, it cannot fully capture the semantic meaning of the language.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For this reason, it has been necessary to go beyond traditional IR methods for more precise information creation based on context and meaning.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"As a result of these requirements, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has come to the fore.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"RAG offers the ability to create richer and contextually meaningful answers to user queries by integrating LLMs with information retrieval processes.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"This architecture allows the language model to instantly access external information sources; thus, it generates more accurate and contextual responses armed with existing information.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"These features of RAG provide appropriate solutions to users’ information-based demands by better understanding the complexity of natural language.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"In this study, it is emphasized that the integration of RAG architecture with information retrieval systems and LLMs provides more\", \"study focus\")"}]}
