For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-01-24,\n    authors: ['Hang Luo', 'Jian Zhang', 'Chujun Li'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: A graph-based approach to closed-domain natural language generation,\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"relationship\"<|>source models in RAG setups<|>zero-shot setting<|>mainly exists and can be closed by collecting few-shot examples for domain-specific use cases<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>code needed to rerun experiments<|>available through GitHub<|>provides access to the implementation of source models<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Causal Graphs Meet Thoughts: Enhancing Complex Reasoning in Graph-Augmented LLMs<|>title of a publication<|>discusses integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG)<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>In knowledge-intensive tasks, especially in high-stakes domains like medicine and law<|>critical aspects of the paper's focus<|>highlights the importance of causal reasoning and explainability in such tasks<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Large language models (LLMs)<|>performance achievements<|>achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process<|>limitations of LLMs<|>discusses common challenges faced by large language models<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG)<|>solution to address challenges<|>emerges as an effective method for enhancing complex reasoning in graph-augmented LLMs<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity<|>limitations of conventional approaches<|>do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns retrieval process with CoT, and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements<|>novel solution proposed in the paper<|>describes an innovative method for integrating causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, up to a 10\\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs)<|>evaluation results<|>demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach in improving performance for complex queries<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval<|>value of the approach<|>leads to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries<|>1)"}]}
