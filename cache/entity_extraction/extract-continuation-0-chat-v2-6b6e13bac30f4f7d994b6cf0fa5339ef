We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

This is a data intensive process; a high-power microscope can easily generate several terabytes of data each day. Tissue characterisation involves workflows that employ a sequence of steps: image segmentation, feature construction, feature selection, feature extraction, classification of features, and annotation of images and image regions. The sheer size of image datasets makes gleaning information from digital microscopy slides a data-intensive process requiring efficient system support. The large number of potentially useful micro-anatomic features and the large number of image preprocessing algorithms makes it essential to develop effective semantically oriented mechanisms to manage, query and curate features and to track provenance associated with the generation of each collection of features.

Imagine that a graduate student enters the Library of Congress with an assignment: she is to find and pull all texts relevant to protein glycosylation. Her problem is straightforward, known among text-miners as information retrieval (IR). If the student must not only find the books, but also to flag the most important concepts she encounters in each, she must perform named entity recognition (NER). Undaunted by her workload, imagine she decides to identify relations between concepts, such as protein BAD binds protein BAX, text-mining researchers call this information extraction (IE). Along with a group of additional tasks, such as question answering and text summarisation (QA and TS, respectively) which we outline below, problems of computational IR, NER and IE belong to a larger field of natural language processing (NLP)â€”human language\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"antically annotated feature sets\", \"title\"),\n(\"describe tissue characteristics of disease at a cellular scale.\", \"description\"),\n(\"This is a data intensive process; a high-power microscope can easily generate several terabytes of data each day.\", \"data-intensive process description\"),\n(\"Tissue characterisation involves workflows that employ a sequence of steps: image segmentation, feature construction, feature selection, feature extraction, classification of features, and annotation of images and image regions.\", \"tissue characterisation workflow\"),\n(\"The sheer size of image datasets makes gleaning information from digital microscopy slides a data-intensive process requiring efficient system support.\", \"data-intensive process requirement\"),\n(\"The large number of potentially useful micro-anatomic features and the large number of image preprocessing algorithms makes it essential to develop effective semantically oriented mechanisms to manage, query and curate features and to track provenance associated with the generation of each collection of features.\", \"feature management necessity\"),\n(\"More information about the work is in [86, 87, 88, 89].\", \"additional references\"),\n(\"Andrey Rzhetsky\", \"speaker\"),\n(\"Department of Medicine\", \"department\"),\n(\"Department of Human Genetics\", \"department\"),\n(\"Computation Institute\", \"department\"),\n(\"Institute for Genomics and Systems Biology\", \"department\"),\n(\"University of Chicago\", \"institution\"),\n(\"The talk is available at: http://www.nesc.ac.uk/action/esi/download.cfm?index=4472.\", \"talk availability\"),\n(\"information retrieval (IR)\", \"task\"),\n(\"named entity recognition (NER)\", \"task\"),\n(\"information extraction (IE)\", \"task\"),\n(\"question answering and text summarisation (QA and TS, respectively)\", \"additional tasks\"),\n(\"problems of computational IR, NER and IE\", \"computational problems\"),\n(\"larger field of natural language processing (NLP)\", \"field\"),\n(\"human language\", \"language context\")"}]}
