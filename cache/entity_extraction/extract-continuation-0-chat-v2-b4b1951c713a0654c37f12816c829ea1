We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: multi-discipline, and multi-national science data. DataONE is transdisciplinary, making biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; making environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; providing secure and long-term preservation and access; and engaging scientists, land-managers, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Curated databases 34 policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualisations. Most importantly, DataONE will serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network. DataONE is a five-year project that began in 2009. I identify key environmental scientific, cyberinfrastructure, and sociocultural challenges and provides a road map for how DataONE is addressing these challenges. Specific examples are based on a DataONE EVA (Exploration, Visualisation and Analysis) Working Group effort to create an integrated database that can be used for better understanding the ecology of bird migrations. The important message is that to succeed in international preservation and access to data we need to recognise the importance of data from the perspective of the scientists to understand the requirements. Scientists want fast access in terms of data and tool discovery, automated/automatic metadata annotation and rapid analysis via appropriate visualisation. They want easy access in terms of data and metadata upload; integrated, linked, and synthesised databases and interoperable and intuitive scientific workflow systems. They want cheap solutions f,\n    publicationDate: 2010-05-01,\n    authors: ['M. Atkinson', 'D. D. Roure', 'Jano van Hemert', 'S. Jha', 'R. McNally', 'Robert Mann', 'Stratis Viglas', 'Christopher K.
