Recent benchmarks designed to assess LLM hallucinations within conventional NLP tasks, such as knowledge-intensive question answering (QA) and summarization, are insufficient for capturing the complexities of user-LLM interactions in dynamic, real-world settings. To address this gap, we introduce HaluEval-Wild, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate LLM hallucinations in the wild. We meticulously collect challenging (adversarially filtered by Alpaca) user queries from ShareGPT, an existing real-world user-LLM interaction datasets, to evaluate the hallucination rates of various LLMs. Upon analyzing the collected queries, we categorize them into five distinct types, which enables a fine-grained analysis of the types of hallucinations LLMs exhibit, and synthesize the reference answers with the powerful GPT-4 model and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our benchmark offers a novel approach towards enhancing our comprehension of and improving LLM reliability in scenarios reflective of real-world interactions.

Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent ap- proach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q&A(Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accu- racy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of docu- ments scales up,with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM.
