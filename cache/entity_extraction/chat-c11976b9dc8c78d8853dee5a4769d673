This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models. Finally, we discuss key future directions for applying knowledge-graphs-empowered RAG frameworks in networking, including robust updates, mitigation of hallucination, and enhanced security measures for\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Paper\", \"the integration of knowledge graphs into RAG frameworks further enhanced the performance of RAG in networking applications such as Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) and spectrum knowledge maps by providing more contextually relevant responses through more accurate retrieval of related network information.\", \"This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking.\")\n(\"Research Topic\", \"the limitations of conventional RAG\", \"Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction.

Since Hydrogen production cost depends on multiple assumptions including materials, electrolyzer design, manufacturing practices, and soft costs, it is difficult to trace back the contribution of the price of a component to the overall system cost. This makes cost of a component to vary from one technical report to another; for instance, a study[12] reported that bipolar plates is the third contributor behind the Catalyst Coated Membrane (CCM) and Porous Transport Layer (PTL) to the stack cost while another article[13] reported it as the highest contributor. It is therefore hard to crystallize on which sub-component deserves the highest focus. Lastly, experts are on a race against time. Understanding how one component affects the overall cost is one thing but how much money must be invested in versus the time it will take to reduce the overall system cost must drive the decisions of the experts. In this work, we addressed the missing link between the slew of information available in literature and the decision to fund research and, by implication, propose an AI-augmented decision tool for knowledge acquisition, knowledge extraction and an evidence-based research funding decision support tool. techniques in include word tokenization, word stemming and lemmatization, topical modeling, named-entity recognition, summarization, word cloud and keyword extraction.
