For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

However, in knowledge-intensive domains, such as intangible cultural heritage, hallucination problems due to insufficient domain knowledge persist. To address this, we present ChatTf, a knowledge graph-enhanced intelligent Q&A system, exemplified by Chinese traditional folklore, aimed at reducing factuality hallucinations in this domain. Specifically, we constructed the Traditional Folklore Ontology (TFOnto) and proposed the Zero-shot Traditional Folklore Triplet Extraction (ZFTE) framework. Driven by TFOnto, ZFTE builds a Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG). We then proposed a dual-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG) based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models, mitigating factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks. In the experimental phase, ChatTf achieved an accuracy of 96.7% on a self-built TFCQD test set, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods. This demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of folklore domain question answering.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Jun Xu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Haijing Zhang', 'Jiawei Lu', 'Gang Xiao'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: Investigating on the External Knowledge in RAG for Zero-Shot Cross-Language Transfer,\n    abstract: In the field of multilingual natural language processing (NLP), zero-shot cross-language transfer is an important research direction, which aims to enable models to effectively learn and reason without target language training data.
