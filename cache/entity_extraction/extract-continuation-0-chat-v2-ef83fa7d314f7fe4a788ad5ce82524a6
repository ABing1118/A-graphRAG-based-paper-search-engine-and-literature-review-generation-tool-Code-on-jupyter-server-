To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.61% to 81.58% in open-ended text generation. Remarkably, our model also achieves the best performance and the lowest latency among several retrieval-augmented baselines. In conclusion, we assert that retrieval is more accurate generation and hope that our work will encourage further research on this new paradigm shift.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-02-27,\n    authors: ['Bowen Cao', 'Deng Cai', 'Leyang Cui', 'Xuxin Cheng', 'Wei Bi', 'Yuexian Zou', 'Shuming Shi'],\n    score: 96.87639203842082\n},\n{\n    title: README: Bridging Medical Jargon and Lay Understanding for Patient Education through Data-Centric NLP,\n    abstract: The advancement in healthcare has shifted focus toward patient-centric approaches, particularly in self-care and patient education, facilitated by access to Electronic Health Records (EHR).
