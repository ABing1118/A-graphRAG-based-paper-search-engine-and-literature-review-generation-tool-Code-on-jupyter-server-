We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: multi-discipline, and multi-national science data.

Most importantly, DataONE will serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network. DataONE is a five-year project that began in 2009. I identify key environmental scientific, cyberinfrastructure, and sociocultural challenges and provides a road map for how DataONE is addressing these challenges. Specific examples are based on a DataONE EVA (Exploration, Visualisation and Analysis) Working Group effort to create an integrated database that can be used for better understanding the ecology of bird migrations. The important message is that to succeed in international preservation and access to data we need to recognise the importance of data from the perspective of the scientists to understand the requirements. Scientists want fast access in terms of data and tool discovery, automated/automatic metadata annotation and rapid analysis via appropriate visualisation. They want easy access in terms of data and metadata upload; integrated, linked, and synthesised databases and interoperable and intuitive scientific workflow systems.

The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-21,\n    authors: ['Jiheng Liang', 'Ziru Yu', 'Zujie Xie', 'Xiangyang Yu'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: TongGu: Mastering Classical Chinese Understanding with Knowledge-Grounded Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Classical Chinese is a gateway to the rich heritage and wisdom of ancient China, yet its complexities pose formidable comprehension barriers for most modern people without specialized knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{TongGu} (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge. Third, we present a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding.
