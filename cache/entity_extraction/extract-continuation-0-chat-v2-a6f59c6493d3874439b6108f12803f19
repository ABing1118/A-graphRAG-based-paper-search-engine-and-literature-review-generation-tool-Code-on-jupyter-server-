We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: individual agents feedback to better serve the results for each of them. Experiments on diverse datasets from the Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantly on average outperforms competitive baselines across 18 RAG models.

Finally, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to explore various aspects of our method.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-13,\n    authors: ['Alireza Salemi', 'Hamed Zamani'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: RAVEN: Multitask Retrieval Augmented Vision-Language Learning,\n    abstract: The scaling of large language models to encode all the world's knowledge in model parameters is unsustainable and has exacerbated resource barriers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a potential solution, yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) is under explored. Existing methods focus on models designed for single tasks. Furthermore, they're limited by the need for resource intensive pre training, additional parameter requirements, unaddressed modality prioritization and lack of clear benefit over non-retrieval baselines. This paper introduces RAVEN, a multitask retrieval augmented VLM framework that enhances base VLMs through efficient, task specific fine-tuning. By integrating retrieval augmented samples without the need for additional retrieval-specific parameters, we show that the model acquires retrieval properties that are effective across multiple tasks. Our results and extensive ablations across retrieved modalities for the image captioning and VQA tasks indicate significant performance improvements compared to non retrieved baselines +1 CIDEr on MSCOCO, +4 CIDEr on NoCaps and nearly a +3\\% accuracy on specific VQA question types. This underscores the efficacy of applying RAG approaches to VLMs, marking a stride toward more efficient and accessible multimodal learning.,\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"individual agents feedback\", \"subject\"),\n(\"better serve results\", \"goal\"),\n(\"diverse datasets\", \"experiments context\"),\n(\"Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"18 RAG models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"approach significantly outperforms competitive baselines\", \"method performance\"),\n(\"personalizes retrieval process for each RAG agent\", \"method feature\"),\n(\"collected feedback\", \"data source\"),\n(\"comprehensive ablation study\", \"evaluation method\"),\n(\"Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark\", \"benchmark\"),\n(\"18 RAG models\", \"comparison models\"),\n(\"multitask Retrieval Augmented Vision-Language Learning (RAVEN)\", \"method introduced\"),\n(\"large language models\", \"context of unsustainability\"),\n(\"unsustainable scaling\", \"issue with large language models\"),\n(\"resource barriers\", \"consequence of unsustainable scaling\"),\n(\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\", \"solution explored\"),\n(\"limited by resource intensive pre training\", \"limitation of existing methods\"),\n(\"additional parameter requirements\", \"requirement for existing methods\"),\n(\"unaddressed modality prioritization\", \"issue with existing methods\"),\n(\"lack of clear benefit over non-retrieval baselines\", \"shortcoming of existing methods\"),\n(\"multitask retrieval augmented VLM framework (RAVEN)\", \"introduced method\"),\n(\"efficient, task specific fine-tuning\", \"method feature\"),\n(\"retrieval properties effective across multiple tasks\", \"acquired capability\"),\n(\"image captioning and VQA tasks\", \"applied tasks\"),\n(\"+1 CIDEr on MSCOCO\", \"performance improvement on one dataset\"),\n(\"+4 CIDEr on NoCaps\", \"performance improvement on another dataset\"),\n(\"nearly a +3% accuracy on specific VQA question types\", \"specific performance improvement\"),\n(\"applying RAG approaches to VLMs\", \"potential impact\"),\n(\"more efficient and accessible multimodal learning\", \"goal of applying RAG to VLMs\")"}]}
