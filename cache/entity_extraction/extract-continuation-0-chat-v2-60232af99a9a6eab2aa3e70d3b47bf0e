This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models. Finally, we discuss key future directions for applying knowledge-graphs-empowered RAG frameworks in networking, including robust updates, mitigation of hallucination, and enhanced security measures for\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Paper\", \"the integration of knowledge graphs into RAG frameworks further enhanced the performance of RAG in networking applications such as Intent-Driven Networks (IDNs) and spectrum knowledge maps by providing more contextually relevant responses through more accurate retrieval of related network information.\", \"This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking.\")\n(\"Research Topic\", \"the limitations of conventional RAG\", \"Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction.

Compared with conventional pre-trained generation models, RAG methods have remarkable advantages such as easy knowledge acquisition, strong scalability, and low training cost. Although existing RAG models have been applied to various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, such as open-domain QA and dialogue systems, most of the work has focused on retrieving unstructured text documents from Wikipedia. In this paper, I first elaborate on the current obstacles to retrieving knowledge from a single-source homogeneous corpus.
