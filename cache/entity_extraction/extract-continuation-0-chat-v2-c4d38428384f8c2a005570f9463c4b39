We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: both superior effectiveness and efficiency, which is validated by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets: TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA.

Instead of fine-tuning a fully parametric model, RaLM excels at its low-cost adaptation to the latest data and better source attribution mechanisms. Among various RaLM approaches, iterative RaLM delivers a better generation quality due to a more frequent interaction between the retriever and the language model. Despite the benefits, iterative RaLM usually encounters high overheads due to the frequent retrieval step. To this end, we propose RaLMSpec, a speculation-inspired framework that provides generic speed-up over iterative RaLM while preserving the same model outputs through speculative retrieval and batched verification. By further incorporating prefetching, optimal speculation stride scheduler, and asynchronous verification, RaLMSpec can automatically exploit the acceleration potential to the fullest. For naive iterative RaLM serving, extensive evaluations over three language models on four downstream QA datasets demonstrate that RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio of 1\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"both superior effectiveness and efficiency\", \"description\"),\n(\"which is validated by extensive experiments across three open-domain question-answering datasets: TriviaQA, NQ and PopQA.\", \"description\"),\n(\"FIT-RAG can improve the answering accuracy of Llama2-13B-Chat by 14.3% on TriviaQA, 19.9% on NQ and 27.5% on PopQA, respectively.\", \"description\"),\n(\"Furthermore, it can save approximately half of the tokens on average across the three datasets.\", \"description\"),\n(\"Yuren Mao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xuemei Dong\", \"author\"),\n(\"Wenyi Xu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yunjun Gao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Bin Wei\", \"author\"),\n(\"Ying Zhang\", \"author\"),\n(\"2024-03-21\", \"publication date\"),\n(\"102.87639203842082\", \"score\"),\n(\"Retrieval-augmented language models (RaLM)\", \"concept\"),\n(\"combining a non-parametric knowledge base with a parametric language model\", \"functionality of RaLM\"),\n(\"fine-tuning a fully parametric model\", \"alternative approach to RaLM\"),\n(\"low-cost adaptation to the latest data and better source attribution mechanisms\", \"benefits of RaLM\"),\n(\"iterative RaLM\", \"specific RaLM approach\"),\n(\"a more frequent interaction between the retriever and the language model\", \"feature of iterative RaLM\"),\n(\"high overheads due to the frequent retrieval step\", \"issue with iterative RaLM\"),\n(\"speculative retrieval and batched verification\", \"approach in RaLMSpec\"),\n(\"prefetching\", \"additional technique in RaLMSpec\"),\n(\"optimal speculation stride scheduler\", \"component of RaLMSpec\"),\n(\"asynchronous verification\", \"feature of RaLMSpec\"),\n(\"speed-up ratio of 1\", \"performance improvement achieved by RaLMSpec\")"}]}
