In this paper, we present the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) architecture for modeling Web-scale heterogeneous graphs. To model heterogeneity, we design node- and edge-type dependent parameters to characterize the heterogeneous attention over each edge, empowering HGT to maintain dedicated representations for different types of nodes and edges. To handle Web-scale graph data, we design the heterogeneous mini-batch graph sampling algorithm—HGSampling—for efficient and scalable training. Extensive experiments on the Open Academic Graph of 179 million nodes and 2 billion edges show that the proposed HGT model consistently outperforms all the state-of-the-art GNN baselines by 9–21 on various downstream tasks. The dataset and source code of HGT are publicly available at https://github.com/acbull/pyHGT.,\n    publicationDate: 2020-03-03,\n    authors: ['Ziniu Hu', 'Yuxiao Dong', 'Kuansan Wang', 'Yizhou Sun'],\n    score: 174.8814464112383\n},\n{\n    title: TransReID: Transformer-based Object Re-Identification,\n    abstract: Extracting robust feature representation is one of the key challenges in object re-identification (ReID). Although convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods have achieved great success, they only process one local neighborhood at a time and suffer from information loss on details caused by convolution and downsampling operators (e.g. pooling and strided convolution). To overcome these limitations, we propose a pure transformer-based object ReID framework named TransReID. Specifically, we first encode an image as a sequence of patches and build a transformer-based strong baseline with a few critical improvements, which achieves competitive results on several ReID benchmarks with CNN-based methods. To further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of transformers, two novel modules are carefully designed.
