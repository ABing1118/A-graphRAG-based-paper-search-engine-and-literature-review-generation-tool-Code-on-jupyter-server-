Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Retrieval in DARSHAN is intensive, and so is the use of networks of lexical concepts. DARSHAN generates ranked sets of either onesentence or one-paragraph homilies. While producing its output, DARSHAN is able to quote 487 Nissan E. and HaCohen-Kerner Y.. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THE SERVICE OF GENERATING NARRATIVE EXPLANATION What we Want from GALLURA.

Use is made of patterns which consist of canned text with places where to plug in strings obtained through IR and manipulation. The user supplies as input a biblical verse, or a sentence, or a set of words, and also specifies which devices should be applied. Filters applied to the candidate output are alert, e.g., to positive vs. negative connotation. The quality of an individual output homily is assessed as a sum of weighted factors, including: length (as an indicator of complicacy); the percentage of relevant words in the homily, out of the total of words in the homily how many sentences there are; how complex it was to insert every motif into the homily generated; how many motifs were actualized in the output homily being evaluated; how many transformations were carried out; how many words were replaced in the homily.
