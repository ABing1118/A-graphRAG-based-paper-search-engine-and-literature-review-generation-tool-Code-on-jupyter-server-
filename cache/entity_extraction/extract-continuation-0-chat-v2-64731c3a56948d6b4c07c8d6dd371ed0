We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: such as model creation, which can lead to wrong responses. This is especially the case for the LLM unknown closed-source simulation software. The same applies to other internal knowledge kept private to protect intellectual property or data privacy. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach might yield a solution for these knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper explores the application of RAG to closed-source simulation software and presents first experiments. After a brief introduction to LLMs, the RAG approach, and the simulation method applied by the close-source simulation software, several examples are provided to test LLMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems. The examples show promising results indicating the benefits of applying RAG systems to closed-source simulation software, helping to access their knowledge. Nevertheless, they also reveal gaps in the applied information and open questions for further research.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-02-06,\n    authors: ['Andreas Baumann', 'Peter Eberhard'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: DuetRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods augment the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) with relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, contemporary RAG approaches suffer from irrelevant knowledge retrieval issues in complex domain questions (e.g., HotPot QA) due to the lack of corresponding domain knowledge, leading to low-quality generations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, DuetRAG. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously integrate the domain fintuning and RAG models to improve the knowledge retrieval quality, thereby enhancing generation quality. Finally, we demonstrate DuetRAG' s matches with expert human researchers on HotPot QA.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-12,\n    authors: ['Dian Jiao', 'Li\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"relationship\"<|>model creation<|>knowledge-intensive tasks<|>can lead to wrong responses<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLM unknown closed-source simulation software<|>knowledge-intensive tasks<|>can lead to wrong responses<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>internal knowledge kept private for intellectual property or data privacy<|>knowledge-intensive tasks<|>can lead to wrong responses<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)<|>solution for knowledge-intensive tasks<|>might yield a solution<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>application of RAG<|>closed-source simulation software<|>helps to access their knowledge<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>examples provided<|>testing LLMs' knowledge<|>show promising results indicating benefits<|>1)\n(\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\", \"approach\"),\n(\"closed-source simulation software\", \"application context\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"task type\"),\n(\"LLM unknown closed-source simulation software\", \"specific issue\"),\n(\"internal knowledge kept private for intellectual property or data privacy\", \"context of challenge\"),\n(\"DuetRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"proposed solution\"),\n(\"Contemporary RAG approaches\", \"comparison context\"),\n(\"irrelevant knowledge retrieval issues\", \"issue addressed\"),\n(\"complex domain questions\", \"specific application scenario\"),\n(\"HotPot QA\", \"benchmark task for evaluation\"),\n(\"domain fintuning and RAG models integration\", \"improved framework philosophy\"),\n(\"knowledge retrieval quality enhancement\", \"framework goal\"),\n(\"generation quality improvement\", \"expected outcome\"),\n(\"expert human researchers' matches\", \"evaluation method\")"}]}
