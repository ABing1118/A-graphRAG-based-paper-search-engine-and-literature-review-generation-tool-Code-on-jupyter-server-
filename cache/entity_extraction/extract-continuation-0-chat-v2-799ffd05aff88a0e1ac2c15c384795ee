The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: computational techniques to the problems faced by our graduate student above, can be thought of as a sub-field of both AI and NLP—but it also stakes a claim for “intellectual independence” with its emphasis on gaining new knowledge. Thus, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Building a virtual data centre for the biological, ecological and environmental sciences 33 while multiple definitions exist, text mining is typically associated with information retrieval, extraction, and synthesis, with a special stress on gaining new knowledge. Moving beyond information retrieval and extraction, some proportion of published assertions can be repackaged to form synthetic ideas, that is, new compound concepts that are significantly more valuable to the scientific community than the sum of their original assertions. In 1986, researcher Don R. Swanson read a collection of scientific articles that spanned different fields of inquiry. Each of these disconnected communities had information valuable to the other, but due to the lack of crosstalk, did not appear to know it. Swanson noticed, in papers produced by researchers interested in Raynaud’s disease, that its symptoms often included increased blood viscosity and rigidity of erythrocytes. Meanwhile, in the nutrition biology community several publications proposed that dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity, without explicitly connecting this finding to Raynaud’s disease. In this early real-world example of synthetic idea generation, Swanson merged these findings to suggest that fish oil can be beneficial for Raynaud’s patients and published his suggestion as a medical hypothesis. The hypothesis was confirmed some years later in an independent randomised clinical trial. Even with current text mining capabilities, such synthetic ideas can be discovered automatically. A more distant but nonetheless realistic aim of the field is to trace and map more sophisticated ideas (idea isomorphisms) that are expressed differently in different scientific fields, yet represent identical problems or their solutions. Were such idea mappings made instantly available through an Internet interface, the result could be truly impressive.
