Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of ARL2, achieving accuracy improvements of 5.4% on NQ and 4.6% on MMLU compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

These systems often distribute queries among various search engines, ranging from specialized (e.g., PubMed) to general (e.g., Google), based on the nature of user utterances. A critical aspect of federated search is resource selection - the selection of appropriate resources prior to issuing the query to ensure high-quality and rapid responses, and contain costs associated with calling the external search engines. However, current SOTA resource selection methodologies primarily rely on feature-based learning approaches. These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive creation of training labels for each resource. In contrast, LLMs have exhibited strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks.
