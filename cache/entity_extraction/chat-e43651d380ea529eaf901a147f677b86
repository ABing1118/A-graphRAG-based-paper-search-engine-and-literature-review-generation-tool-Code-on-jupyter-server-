We propose GRAFT (Graph Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning), a novel approach that combines the strengths of the Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) methodology and the GraphRAG technique. GRAFT fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) on a simulated imperfect retrieval setting, training the model to identify relevant documents and ignore distractors in the provided context. The model is then coupled with graphRAG at inference. To investigate the effectiveness of the GRAFT methodology, we constructed a knowledge graph using \n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"S.
