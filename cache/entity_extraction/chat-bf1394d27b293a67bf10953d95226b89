transformer-based object ReID framework named TransReID. Specifically, we first encode an image as a sequence of patches and build a transformer-based strong baseline with a few critical improvements, which achieves competitive results on several ReID benchmarks with CNN-based methods. To further enhance the robust feature learning in the context of transformers, two novel modules are carefully designed. (i) The jigsaw patch module (JPM) is proposed to rearrange the patch embeddings via shift and patch shuffle operations which generates robust features with improved discrimination ability and more diversified coverage. (ii) The side information embeddings (SIE) is introduced to mitigate feature bias towards camera/view variations by plugging in learnable embeddings to incorporate these non-visual clues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to adopt a pure transformer for ReID research. Experimental results of TransReID are superior promising, which achieve state-of-the-art performance on both person and vehicle ReID benchmarks.

To address these problems, we propose to combine Transformer with the seasonal-trend decomposition method, in which the decomposition method captures the global profile of time series while Transformers capture more detailed structures. To further enhance the performance of Transformer for long-term prediction, we exploit the fact that\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2.5:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 8000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
