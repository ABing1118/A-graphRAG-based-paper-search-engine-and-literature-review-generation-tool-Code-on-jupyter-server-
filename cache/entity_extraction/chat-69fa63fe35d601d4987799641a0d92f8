The introduction of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has significantly advanced this field by integrating external knowledge bases into LLMs for real-time access to professional expertise during inference. However, traditional RAG systems based on flat text retrieval face several challenges: complex query understanding in professional contexts, difficulties in integrating knowledge across distributed sources, and system efficiency issues at scale.\n\nThis paper presents a comprehensive survey of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), an innovative approach that addresses these limitations through three core advancements:\n\n1. **Graph-Structured Knowledge Representation**: By leveraging graph structures, GraphRAG explicitly models entity relationships and domain hierarchies, providing a more nuanced understanding of the knowledge space compared to flat text representations.\n\n2. **Efficient Graph-Based Retrieval Techniques**: This innovation enables context-preserving retrieval that is both scalable and efficient, overcoming limitations in traditional RAG systems where retrieval performance degrades with increasing data size or complexity.\n\n3. **Enhanced Integration Mechanisms**: GraphRAG introduces sophisticated mechanisms for integrating retrieved knowledge into the generation process seamlessly, ensuring that the generated responses are not only accurate but also contextually relevant and coherent.\n\n#### Key Findings:\n- **Effectiveness**: Empirical evaluations across diverse datasets and models demonstrate that GraphRAG significantly outperforms existing RAG systems in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability, using less than 68% of the poisoning text required by traditional methods.\n- **Scalability**: The graph-based approach allows for efficient handling of large-scale data without compromising on retrieval speed or accuracy, making it suitable for real-world applications with extensive knowledge bases.\n\n#### Limitations and Future Directions:\nThe survey also critically examines potential defensive measures against GraphRAG attacks and discusses their limitations. It highlights promising research directions that aim to enhance security while maintaining the benefits of GraphRAG in customized LLMs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGraph Retrieval-Augmented Generation represents a significant step forward in customizing large language models for professional domains by addressing key challenges through graph-based knowledge representation, efficient retrieval techniques, and enhanced integration mechanisms. This survey not only provides an overview of current advancements but also outlines future research opportunities to further improve the robustness and applicability of GraphRAG systems.\n\n#### Keywords:\n- Large Language Models (LLMs)\n- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- Graph-Based Retrieval\n- Domain-Specific Expertise\n- Customization in Professional Fields", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Our experimental results demonstrate that GRAFT outperforms baseline models, including the Baseline RAG model, the RAFT model, and the Baseline GraphRAG model, across various evaluation metrics like BERT, BLEU, ROUGE-1, and Semantic Similarity.

GRAGPoison employs three key strategies: i) relation injection to introduce false knowledge, ii) relation enhancement to amplify poisoning influence, and iii) narrative generation to embed malicious content within coherent text. Empirical evaluation across diverse datasets and models shows that GRAGPoison substantially outperforms existing attacks in terms of effectiveness (up to 98% success rate) and scalability (using less than 68% poisoning text). We also explore potential defensive measures and their limitations, identifying promising directions for future research.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-01-23,\n    authors: ['Jiacheng Liang', 'Yuhui Wang', 'Changjiang Li', 'Rongyi Zhu', 'Tanqiu Jiang', 'Neil Gong', 'Ting Wang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: A Survey of Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Customized Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in a wide range of tasks, yet their application to specialized domains remains challenging due to the need for deep expertise. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to customize LLMs for professional fields by seamlessly integrating external knowledge bases, enabling real-time access to domain-specific expertise during inference. Despite its potential, traditional RAG systems, based on flat text retrieval, face three critical challenges: (i) complex query understanding in professional contexts, (ii) difficulties in knowledge integration across distributed sources, and (iii) system efficiency bottlenecks at scale. This survey presents a systematic analysis of Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (GraphRAG), a new paradigm that revolutionizes domain-specific LLM applications. GraphRAG addresses traditional RAG limitations through three key innovations: (i) graph-structured knowledge representation that explicitly captures entity relationships and domain hierarchies, (ii) efficient graph-based retrieval techniques that enable context-preserving\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
