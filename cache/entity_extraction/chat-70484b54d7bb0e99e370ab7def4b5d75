{"result": "Title: GraphJudger: A Knowledge Graph Construction Framework Leveraging Large Language Models\n\nAbstract:\nThe construction of structured knowledge graphs from real-world documents presents significant challenges due to the vast amount of information and noise inherent in such data, as well as difficulties in extracting accurate knowledge from domain-specific sources. Moreover, the phenomenon of hallucinations when using large language models (LLMs) directly for unsupervised knowledge graph construction cannot be overlooked. To address these issues, this paper introduces GraphJudger, a novel framework designed to construct knowledge graphs.\n\nGraphJudger incorporates three innovative modules:\n1. **Entity-Centric Iterative Text Denoising**: This module focuses on refining and cleaning the text data by iteratively removing noise and irrelevant information associated with entities.\n2. **Knowledge-Aware Instruction Tuning**: It enhances the model's ability to understand and extract knowledge from documents by tuning instructions based on the context of the extracted knowledge, ensuring accuracy in domain-specific scenarios.\n3. **Graph Judgement Module**: This module leverages the capabilities of LLMs beyond mere prediction tasks, enabling them to act as effective graph judges capable of assessing the validity and relevance of information for inclusion in a knowledge graph.\n\nExperiments conducted on datasets that include both general text-graph pairs and domain-specific ones demonstrate superior performance compared to baseline methods. The availability of GraphJudger's code is provided at [https://github.com/hhy-huang/GraphJudger](https://github.com/hhy-huang/GraphJudger), allowing for further research, adaptation, and implementation in various applications.\n\nKeywords: Knowledge graph construction, Large language models (LLMs), Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), Entity-centric denoising, Domain-specific knowledge extraction", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity and a list of entity types, identify all entities of those types from the text and all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

Our experimental results demonstrate that GRAFT outperforms baseline models, including the Baseline RAG model, the RAFT model, and the Baseline GraphRAG model, across various evaluation metrics like BERT, BLEU, ROUGE-1, and Semantic Similarity.

And we have identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods. (1)There is a large amount of information and excessive noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2)Native LLMs struggle to effectively extract accuracy knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3)Hallucinations phenomenon cannot be overlooked when utilizing LLMs directly as an unsupervised method for constructing KGs. In this paper, we propose GraphJudger, a knowledge graph construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We introduce three innovative modules in our method, which are entity-centric iterative text denoising, knowledge aware instruction tuning and graph judgement, respectively. We seek to utilize the capacity of LLMs to function as a graph judger, a capability superior to their role only as a predictor for KG construction problems. Experiments conducted on two general text-graph pair datasets and one domain-specific text-graph pair dataset show superior performances compared to baseline methods.
