However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge. We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate R\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"relationship\"<|>external knowledge<|>RAG<|>Utilizing external knowledge can enhance performance in retrieval augmented generation (RAG)<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>in-context learning<|>RAG<|>In-context learning provides additional flexibility to scale test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iterative prompting<|>RAG<|>Iterative prompting offers another strategy beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge in scaling inference for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>retrieved documents<|>RAG<|>Increasing retrieved documents can enhance LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information during test-time computation<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>generation steps<|>RAG<|>Increasing generation steps provides additional flexibility in scaling test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>optimal configuration<|>RAG performance<|>The scaling of inference computation benefits RAG performance when optimally configured<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>budget allocation<|>optimal test-time compute<|>We can predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>nearly linear gains<|>inference scaling laws<|>Increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, describing the inference scaling laws for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>computation allocation model<|>RAG<|>We develop a computation allocation model to estimate RAG's performance based on different inference parameters and budget allocations<|>2)\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\ntext:\n\",\n    \"score\": 94.1415686865115\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"title\": \"Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by sourcing factual information from external databases, which is extensively employed in document-grounded question-answering (QA) tasks.

Based on this analysis, we propose a new approach for KG-RAG systems, termed Mindful-RAG, which re-engineers the retrieval process to be more intent-driven and contextually aware. By enhancing reasoning capabilities, improving constraint identification, and addressing the structural limitations of knowledge graphs, we aim to improve the reliability and effectiveness of KG-RAG systems. To validate this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept by integrating the principles of Mindful-RAG into an existing KG-RAG system. The Mindful-RAG approach seeks to deliver more robust, accurate, and contextually aligned AI-driven knowledge retrieval systems, with potential applications in critical domains such as healthcare, legal, research, and scientific discovery, where precision and reliability are paramount.\",\n    \"venue\": \"2024 2nd International Conference on Foundation and Large Language Models (FLLM)\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 1,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12216\",\n      \"status\": \"GREEN\"\n    },\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-07-16\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"145363324\",\n        \"name\": \"Garima Agrawal\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"40899329\",\n        \"name\": \"Tharindu Kumarage\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2185743354\",\n        \"name\": \"Zeyad Alghamdi\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2146398603\",\n        \"name\": \"Huanmin Liu\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 80.39720770839918\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"b5b200d405b099a88a838f0428aaa817dcb61714\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/b5b200d405b099a88a838f0428aaa817dcb61714\",\n    \"title\": \"MBA-RAG: a Bandit Approach for Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation through Question Complexity\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven to be highly effective in boosting the generative performance of language model in knowledge-intensive tasks.
