However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge. We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate R\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"relationship\"<|>external knowledge<|>RAG<|>Utilizing external knowledge can enhance performance in retrieval augmented generation (RAG)<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>in-context learning<|>RAG<|>In-context learning provides additional flexibility to scale test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iterative prompting<|>RAG<|>Iterative prompting offers another strategy beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge in scaling inference for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>retrieved documents<|>RAG<|>Increasing retrieved documents can enhance LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information during test-time computation<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>generation steps<|>RAG<|>Increasing generation steps provides additional flexibility in scaling test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>optimal configuration<|>RAG performance<|>The scaling of inference computation benefits RAG performance when optimally configured<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>budget allocation<|>optimal test-time compute<|>We can predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>nearly linear gains<|>inference scaling laws<|>Increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, describing the inference scaling laws for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>computation allocation model<|>RAG<|>We develop a computation allocation model to estimate RAG's performance based on different inference parameters and budget allocations<|>2)\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\ntext:\n\",\n    \"score\": 94.1415686865115\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"title\": \"Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by sourcing factual information from external databases, which is extensively employed in document-grounded question-answering (QA) tasks.

This paper proposes SynCheck, a lightweight monitor that leverages fine-grained decoding dynamics including sequence likelihood, uncertainty quantification, context influence, and semantic alignment to synchronously detect unfaithful sentences. By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search for long-form retrieval-augmented generation. Empirical results demonstrate that FOD outperforms traditional strategies such as abstention, reranking, or contrastive decoding significantly in terms of faithfulness, achieving over 10% improvement across six datasets.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-06-19\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2107535909\",\n        \"name\": \"Di Wu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2308241925\",\n        \"name\": \"Jia-Chen Gu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2281946748\",\n        \"name\": \"Fan Yin\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2256996328\",\n        \"name\": \"Nanyun Peng\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2257127887\",\n        \"name\": \"Kai-Wei Chang\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"52008bf2a58054e38a7b630dcf021e1c9bf8d109\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52008bf2a58054e38a7b630dcf021e1c9bf8d109\",\n    \"title\": \"Adapting Large Language Models for Biomedicine though Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Documents Scoring\",\n    \"abstract\": \"By integrating the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external biomedical knowledge repositories, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers significant potential for addressing knowledge-intensive biomedical tasks, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of clinical decision-making.
