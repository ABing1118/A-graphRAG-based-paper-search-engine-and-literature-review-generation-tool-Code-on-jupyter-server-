Traditional data retrieval methods such as sequential search and index-based retrieval often fail when handling intricate and interconnected data structures, resulting in incomplete or misleading outputs. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Structured-GraphRAG, a versatile framework designed to enhance information retrieval across structured datasets in natural language queries. Structured-GraphRAG utilizes multiple knowledge graphs, which represent data in a structured format and capture complex relationships between entities, enabling a more nuanced and comprehensive retrieval of information. This graph-based approach reduces the risk of errors in language model outputs by grounding responses in a structured format, thereby enhancing the reliability of results. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Structured-GraphRAG by comparing its performance with that of a recently published method using traditional retrieval-augmented generation. Our findings show that Structured-GraphRAG significantly improves query processing efficiency and reduces response times. While our case study focuses on soccer data, the framework's design is broadly applicable, offering a powerful tool for data analysis and enhancing language model applications across various structured\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity_types\", \"Paper\"),\n(\"text\", \".com/Graph-RAG/GraphRAG/.\"),\n(\"publicationDate\", \"2024-12-31\"),\n(\"authors\", ['Haoyu Han', 'Yu Wang', 'Harry Shomer', 'Kai Guo', 'Jiayuan Ding', 'Yongjia Lei', 'M.
