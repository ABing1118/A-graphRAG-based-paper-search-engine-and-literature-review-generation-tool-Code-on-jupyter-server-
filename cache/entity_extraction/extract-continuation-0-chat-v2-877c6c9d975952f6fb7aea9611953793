Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: an iterative retrieval-generation collaborative framework.

However, the architecture used for FiD was chosen by making minimal modifications to a standard T5 model, which our analysis shows to be highly suboptimal for a retrieval-augmented model. In particular, FiD allocates the bulk of FLOPs to the encoder, while the majority of inference time results from memory bandwidth constraints in the decoder. We propose two simple changes to the FiD architecture to alleviate memory bandwidth constraints, and speed up inference by 7x. This allows us to use a much larger decoder at modest cost. We denote FiD with the above modifications as FiDO, and show that it strongly improves performance over existing FiD models for a wide range of inference budgets. For example, FiDO-Large-XXL performs faster inference than FiD-Base and achieves better performance than FiD-Large.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-12-15,\n    authors: ['Michiel de Jong', 'Yury Zem\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"an iterative retrieval-generation collaborative framework\", \"title\"),\n(\"It is not only able to leverage both parametric and non-parametric knowledge, but also helps to find the correct reasoning path through retrieval-generation interactions.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"which is very important for tasks that require multi-step reasoning\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We conduct experiments on four question answering datasets, including single-hop QA and multi-hop QA tasks\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Empirical results show that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of large language models and outperforms previous baselines\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Zhangyin Feng\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xiaocheng Feng\", \"author\"),\n(\"Dezhi Zhao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Maojin Yang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Bing Qin\", \"author\"),\n(\"2023-10-08\", \"publicationDate\"),\n(\"Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD)\", \"title\"),\n(\"Fusion-in-Decoder optimized for stronger performance and faster inference\", \"title\"),\n(\"Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) is a powerful retrieval-augmented language model that sets the state-of-the-art on many knowledge-intensive NLP tasks\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"However, the architecture used for FiD was chosen by making minimal modifications to a standard T5 model\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"which our analysis shows to be highly suboptimal for a retrieval-augmented model\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"In particular, FiD allocates the bulk of FLOPs to the encoder\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"while the majority of inference time results from memory bandwidth constraints in the decoder\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We propose two simple changes to the FiD architecture to alleviate memory bandwidth constraints\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"and speed up inference by 7x\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"This allows us to use a much larger decoder at modest cost\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"FiDO-Large-XXL performs faster inference than FiD-Base and achieves better performance than FiD-Large\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Michiel de Jong\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yury Zem\", \"author\"),\n(\"2022-12-15\", \"publicationDate\")"}]}
