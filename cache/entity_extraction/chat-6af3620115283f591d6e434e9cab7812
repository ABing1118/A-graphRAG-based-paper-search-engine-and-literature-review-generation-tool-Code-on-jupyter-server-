Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\ntext:\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"fcefbb496545d2174270f27183cefa14f2830892\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fcefbb496545d2174270f27183cefa14f2830892\",\n    \"title\": \"Retrieval-augmented Generation across Heterogeneous Knowledge\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been receiving increasing attention from the NLP community and achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP downstream tasks.

Different from retrieval-augmented language models that retrieve relevant documents before generating the outputs, given an input, RECITE first recites one or several relevant passages from LLMs' own memory via sampling, and then produces the final answers. We show that RECITE is a powerful paradigm for knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. Specifically, we show that by utilizing recitation as the intermediate step, a recite-and-answer scheme can achieve new state-of-the-art performance in various closed-book question answering (CBQA) tasks. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of \\\\method~on four pre-trained models (PaLM, UL2, OPT, and Codex) and three CBQA tasks (Natural Questions, TriviaQA, and HotpotQA).
