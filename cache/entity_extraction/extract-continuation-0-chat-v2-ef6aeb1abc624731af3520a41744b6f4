We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: -of-concept by integrating the principles of Mindful-RAG into an existing KG-RAG system.

However, the reliability of these models in terms of factual accuracy and timely knowledge acquisition remains a challenge. Researchers explore the implementation of retrieval-augmented generation methods, aiming to enhance the authenticity and specificity in knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper discusses the practical application in industrial settings, particularly in assisting design personnel with navigating complex standards and quality manuals. Utilizing an open-source model with 6 billion parameters, the study employs quantization technology for local deployment, addressing computational challenges. The retrieval-augmented generation framework is analyzed, emphasizing the integration of document parsing, vector databases, and text embedding models. Experimental results compare models at different quantization levels, revealing trade-offs between response time, model size, and performance metrics. The findings suggest that 4-bit integer quantization is optimal for standard document retrieval and question-answering tasks, highlighting practical considerations for CPU inference. The paper concludes with insights into hyper-parameter tuning, model comparisons, and future optimizations for enhanced performance in edge device deployments of large language models.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-11-24,\n    authors: ['Shanglin Yang', 'Jialin Zhu', 'Jialin Wang', 'Xiaohan Xu', 'Zihang Shao', 'Liwei Yao', 'Benchang Zheng', 'Hu Huang'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: KNIMEZoBot: Enhancing Literature Review with Zotero and KNIME OpenAI Integration using Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Academic researchers face challenges keeping up with exponentially growing published findings in their field. Performing comprehensive literature reviews to synthesize knowledge is time-consuming and labor-intensive using manual approaches. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide promising solutions, yet many require coding expertise, limiting accessibility. KNIMEZoBot represents an innovative integration of Zotero, OpenAI, and the KNIME visual programming platform to automate literature review tasks for users with no coding experience. By leveraging KNIME's intuitive graphical interface, researchers can create workflows to search their Zotero libraries and utilize OpenAI models to extract key information without coding. Users simply provide API keys and configure settings through a user-friendly interface in a locally stored copy of the workflow. KNIMEZoBot then allows asking natural language questions via a chatbot and retrieves relevant passages from papers to generate synthesized answers. This system has significant potential to expedite literature reviews for researchers unfamiliar with coding by automating retrieval and analysis of publications in personal Zotero libraries. KNIMEZoBot demonstrates how thoughtfully designed AI tools can expand accessibility and accelerate knowledge building across diverse research domains.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-11-07,\n    authors: ['S.

Fine-tuning LLMs with external data is costly and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates relevant external information dynamically. We introduce GeneRAG, a frame-work that enhances LLMsâ€™ gene-related capabilities using RAG and the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Evaluations with datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) show that GeneRAG outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with a 39% improvement in answering gene questions, a 43% performance increase in cell type annotation, and a 0.25 decrease in error rates for gene interaction prediction.
