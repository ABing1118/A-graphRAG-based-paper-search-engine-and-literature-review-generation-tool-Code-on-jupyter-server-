To use it with real data from `papers.txt`, you would replace the example JSON string with the contents of your file, possibly using Python's built-in `open` function to read the file.\n\nPlease note that this is just an example implementation and might need adjustments based on how your JSON files are structured or if they contain additional fields."}]}
