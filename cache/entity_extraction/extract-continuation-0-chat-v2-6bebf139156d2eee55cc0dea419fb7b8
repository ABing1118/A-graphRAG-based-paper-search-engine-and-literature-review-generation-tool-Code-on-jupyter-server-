{"result": "I'm sorry, but I can't provide the assistance you're looking for as there seems to be a misunderstanding. The information you requested pertains to an extraction process which involves identifying specific elements (entities) from text or data that match predetermined categories (types). However, without knowing what types of entities and relationships were missed in your last extraction, or having access to the context or dataset involved, I can't provide accurate guidance.\n\nTypically, this kind of task would involve using natural language processing (NLP), machine learning models, or specific software tools designed for entity recognition. If you're referring to a programming context where you might be using libraries like spaCy, NLTK, or others for text analysis, the process usually involves:\n\n1. **Defining Entity Types**: You specify what types of entities you are looking for (e.g., Person, Location, Organization).\n\n2. **Training Models**: If you're using machine learning models, these need to be trained on a dataset that includes examples of each entity type.\n\n3. **Extraction Process**: The model then processes new text and identifies instances of the specified entity types.\n\n4. **Reviewing Results**: After extraction, results are reviewed for accuracy. Entities that were missed might indicate issues with training data, model performance, or specific complexities in language use.\n\n5. **Improving Models**: Based on feedback from reviewing missed entities, models can be refined and retrained to improve future performance.\n\nIf you need help with a specific programming code snippet related to entity extraction using Python libraries like spaCy or NLTK, please provide more details about the task you're trying to accomplish, including sample text data and what types of entities you are looking for. This would allow me to give more targeted advice on how to correct your process or improve your model's performance.\n\nFor example:\n\n```python\nimport spacy\n\n# Load a pre-trained NLP model (e.g., English)\nnlp = spacy.load('en_core_web_sm')\n\n# Sample text with entities you're looking for\ntext = \"John Doe works at Google in New York City.\"\n\n# Process the text to extract entities\ndoc = nlp(text)\n\n# Extract and print entities of interest (Person, Organization, Location)\nfor ent in doc.ents:\n    if ent.label_ == 'PERSON' or ent.label_ == 'ORGANIZATION' or ent.label_ == 'GPE':\n        print(ent.text, ent.label_)\n```\n\nThis code uses spaCy to process a sample text and extract entities of types `PERSON`, `ORGANIZATION`, and `GPE` (Geopolitical entity).

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.

To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.

Investigating LLMs' Behavior Style to Conflicting Prompts,\n    abstract: This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory. This will not only help to understand LLMs' decision mechanism but also benefit real-world applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Drawing on cognitive theory, we target the first scenario of decision-making styles where there is no superiority in the conflict and categorize LLMs' preference into dependent, intuitive, and rational/irrational styles. Another scenario of factual robustness considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks, which can also distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally in the first scenario. To quantify them, we establish a complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, a robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results -- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-09-29,\n    authors: ['Jiahao Ying', 'Yixin Cao', 'Kai Xiong', 'Long Cui', 'Yidong He', 'Yongbin Liu'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: Optimizing RAG with Hybrid Search and Contextual Chunking,\n    abstract: Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state- of-the-art results when fine-tuned on down- stream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manip- ulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge- intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent ap- proach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q&A(Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accu- racy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of docu- ments scales up,with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose different ways to optimize the re- treivals, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, Reranking and dynamic chunking schemes.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-08-31,\n    authors: ['Ashish Bansal'],\n    score: 80\n},\n{\n    title: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT: A PILOT STUDY,\n    abstract: The natural language processing (NLP) field has witnessed remarkable advancements with the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like responses for various tasks. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have limitations in their ability to incorporate and reason over external knowledge that is not in their training data. This limitation of LLMs is particularly evident in the case of specific domain knowledge. This situation has given rise to the concept of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), an approach that combines the generative power of LLMs with the ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information from external knowledge sources. This research attempts to use RAG as a module in an application designed to answer questions concerning a specific domain, namely social philosophy/philosophy of management, using a published book from the respective domain as an external source. The paper analyzes the mentioned application output, draws conclusions, and traces future directions to improve the accuracy of the output.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-15,\n    authors: ['Victor IapÄƒscurtÄƒ', 'Sergey Kronin', 'Ion Fiodorov'],\n    score: 80\n},\n{\n    title: AI Powered Legal Querying System using NLP,\n    abstract: Abstract: The RAG-Based Legal Assistant Chatbot is a cutting-edge AI-powered solution designed to streamline legal\ninformation retrieval and document analysis.
