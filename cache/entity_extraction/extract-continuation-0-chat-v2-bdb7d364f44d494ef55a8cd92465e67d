We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: partite foundation of RAG frameworks, which includes the retrieval, the generation and the augmentation techniques.

Nevertheless, LLMs are prone to hallucination, generating plausible yet nonfactual content. This phenomenon raises significant concerns over the reliability of LLMs in real-world information retrieval (IR) systems and has attracted intensive research to detect and mitigate such hallucinations. Given the open-ended general-purpose attributes inherent to LLMs, LLM hallucinations present distinct challenges that diverge from prior task-specific models. This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"partite foundation\", \"RAG frameworks\"),\n(\"retrieval\", \"critical component\"),\n(\"generation\", \"critical component\"),\n(\"augmentation techniques\", \"critical component\"),\n(\"state-of-the-art technologies\", \"embedded in components\"),\n(\"evaluation framework\", \"up-to-date\"),\n(\"benchmark\", \"introduced\"),\n(\"challenges\", \"faced currently\"),\n(\"prospective avenues for research and development\", \"pointed out\"),\n(\"Yunfan Gao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yun Xiong\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xinyu Gao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Kangxiang Jia\", \"author\"),\n(\"Jinliu Pan\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yuxi Bi\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yi Dai\", \"author\"),\n(\"Jiawei Sun\", \"author\"),\n(\"Qianyu Guo\", \"author\"),\n(\"Meng Wang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Haofen Wang\", \"author\"),\n(\"2023-12-18\", \"publication date\"),\n(\"A Survey on Hallucination in Large Language Models: Principles, Taxonomy, Challenges, and Open Questions\", \"title\"),\n(\"large language models (LLMs)\", \"discussed topic\"),\n(\"natural language processing (NLP)\", \"context\"),\n(\"hallucination detection methods\", \"presented overview\"),\n(\"hallucinations\", \"distinct challenges\"),\n(\"open-ended general-purpose attributes\", \"inherent to LLMs\"),\n(\"recent advances in LLM hallucinations\", \"urgency for understanding\")"}]}
