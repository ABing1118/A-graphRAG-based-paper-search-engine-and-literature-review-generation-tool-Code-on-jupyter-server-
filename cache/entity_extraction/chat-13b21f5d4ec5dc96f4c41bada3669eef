Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: LMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results -- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-09-29,\n    authors: ['Jiahao Ying', 'Yixin Cao', 'Kai Xiong', 'Long Cui', 'Yidong He', 'Yongbin Liu'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: Optimizing RAG with Hybrid Search and Contextual Chunking,\n    abstract: Large pre-trained language models have been shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters, and achieve state- of-the-art results when fine-tuned on down- stream NLP tasks. However, their ability to access and precisely manip- ulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge- intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent ap- proach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q&A(Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accu- racy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of docu- ments scales up,with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose different ways to optimize the re- treivals, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, Reranking and dynamic chunking schemes.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-08-31,\n    authors: ['Ashish Bansal'],\n    score: 80\n},\n{\n    title: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT: A PILOT STUDY,\n    abstract: The natural language processing (NLP) field has witnessed remarkable advancements with the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like responses for various tasks. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have limitations in their ability to incorporate and reason over external knowledge that is not in their training data. This limitation of LLMs is particularly evident in the case of specific domain knowledge. This situation has given rise to the concept of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), an approach that combines the generative power of LLMs with the ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information from external knowledge sources. This research attempts to use RAG as a module in an application designed to answer questions concerning a specific domain, namely social philosophy/philosophy of management, using a published book from the respective domain as an external source. The paper analyzes the mentioned application output, draws conclusions, and traces future directions to improve the accuracy of the output.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-15,\n    authors: ['Victor Iapăscurtă', 'Sergey Kronin', 'Ion Fiodorov'],\n    score: 80\n},\n{\n    title: AI Powered Legal Querying System using NLP,\n    abstract: Abstract: The RAG-Based Legal Assistant Chatbot is a cutting-edge AI-powered solution designed to streamline legal\ninformation retrieval and document analysis.
