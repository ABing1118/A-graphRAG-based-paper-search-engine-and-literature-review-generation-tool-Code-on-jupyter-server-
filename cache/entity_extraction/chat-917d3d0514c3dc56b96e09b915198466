Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\ntext:\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"fcefbb496545d2174270f27183cefa14f2830892\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fcefbb496545d2174270f27183cefa14f2830892\",\n    \"title\": \"Retrieval-augmented Generation across Heterogeneous Knowledge\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been receiving increasing attention from the NLP community and achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP downstream tasks.

However, outdated knowledge and hallucination issues can be major obstacles in their application in knowledge-intensive biomedical scenarios. In this study, we consider the task of biomedical concept recognition (CR) from unstructured scientific literature and explore the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy and reliability of the LLM-based biomedical CR. Our approach, named REAL (Retrieval Augmented Entity Linking), combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with curated knowledge bases to automatically annotate natural language texts with concepts from bio-ontologies. By applying REAL to benchmark corpora on phenotype concept recognition, we show its effectiveness in improving LLM-based CR performance. This research highlights the potential of combining LLMs with external knowledge sources to advance biomedical text processing.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 3,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": null,\n    \"authors\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
