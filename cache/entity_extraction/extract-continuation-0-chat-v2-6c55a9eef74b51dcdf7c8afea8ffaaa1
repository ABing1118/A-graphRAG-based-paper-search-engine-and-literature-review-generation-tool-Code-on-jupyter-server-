This problem hinders their potential for building truly conversational applications. To address this problem, we propose an approach to integrating memory into LLMs using GraphRAG, which is a framework that leverages Knowledge Graph and Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques for retrieving historical interactions. By representing the key knowledge contained in the dialogue history as a knowledge graph, we can capture complex relationships between entities and concepts mentioned in previous turns. We also introduce a mechanism for effectively accessing relevant nodes with the current query, allowing for more focused and efficient recall of past interactions. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets for question answering, text summarization, and dialogue systems, demonstrating significant improvements in performance compared to baseline LLMs. Our findings highlight the potential of GraphRAG as a powerful tool for equipping LLMs with robust memory capabilities, paving the way for more sophisticated and context-aware AI applications,\n    publication\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"Structured-GraphRAG\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\")\n{\n    title: \"Structured-GraphRAG\",\n    publicationDate: \"2024-09-26\",\n    authors: [\"Zahra Sepasdar\", \"Sushant Gautam\", \"Cise Midoglu\", \"M.
