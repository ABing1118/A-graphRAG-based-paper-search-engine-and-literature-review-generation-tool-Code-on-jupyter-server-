Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.

This method addresses common LLM limitations, including outdated information and the tendency to produce inaccurate “hallucinated” content. However, evaluating RAG systems is a challenge. Most benchmarks focus primarily on question answering applications, neglecting other potential scenarios where RAG could be beneficial. Accordingly, in the experiments, these benchmarks often assess only the LLM components of the RAG pipeline or the retriever in knowledge-intensive scenarios, overlooking the impact of external knowledge base construction and the retrieval component on the entire RAG pipeline in non-knowledge-intensive scenarios. To address these issues, this paper constructs a large-scale and more comprehensive benchmark, and evaluates all the components of RAG systems in various RAG application scenarios. Specifically, we refer to the CRUD actions that describe interactions between users and knowledge bases, and also categorize the range of RAG applications into four distinct types–Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD). “Create” refers to scenarios requiring the generation of original, varied content. “Read” involves responding to intricate questions in knowledge-intensive situations. “Update” focuses on revising and rectifying inaccuracies or inconsistencies in pre-existing texts. “Delete” pertains to the task of summarizing extensive texts into more concise forms. For each of these CRUD categories, we have developed different datasets to evaluate the performance of RAG systems. We also analyze the effects of various components of the RAG system, such as the retriever, context length, knowledge base construction, and LLM. Finally, we provide useful insights for optimizing the RAG technology for different scenarios\n \n 1\n \n .\n,\n    publicationDate: 2024-01-30,\n    authors: ['Yuanjie Lyu', 'Zhiyu Li', 'Simin Niu', 'Feiyu\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
