We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: 25-27%, and GPT-4o by 18-20% in terms of open-ended VQA evaluation metrics. To our surprise, we discover that RIR helps the model to better access its own world knowledge. Concretely, our experiments suggest that RIR augmentation helps by providing further visual and textual cues without necessarily containing the direct answer to a query. In addition, we elucidate cases in which RIR can hurt performance and conduct a human evaluation. Finally, we find that the overall advantage of using RIR makes it difficult for an agent that can choose to use RIR to perform better than an approach where RIR is the default setting.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-29,\n    authors: ['Jialiang Xu', 'Michael Moor', 'J.

However, these models are memory and computation-intensive. Meta-training allows one to leverage smaller models for few-shot generalization in a domain-general and task-agnostic manner; however, these methods alone results in models that may not have sufficient parameterization or knowledge to adapt quickly to a large variety of tasks. To overcome this issue, we propose meta-training with demonstration retrieval, where we use a dense passage retriever to retrieve semantically similar labeled demonstrations to each example for more varied supervision. By separating external knowledge from model parameters, we can use meta-training to train parameter-efficient models that generalize well on a larger variety of tasks. We construct a meta-training set from UnifiedQA and CrossFit, and propose a demonstration bank based on UnifiedQA tasks. To our knowledge, our work is the first to combine retrieval with meta-training, to use DPR models to retrieve demonstrations, and to leverage demonstrations from many tasks simultaneously, rather than randomly sampling demonstrations from the training set of the target task. Our approach outperforms a variety of targeted parameter-efficient and retrieval-augmented few-shot methods on QA, NLI, and text classification tasks (including SQuAD, QNLI, and TREC). Our approach can be meta-trained and fine-tuned quickly on a single GPU.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-06-30,\n    authors: ['Aaron Mueller', 'Kanika Narang', 'Lambert Mathias', 'Qifan Wang', 'Hamed Firooz'],\n    score: 86.47918433002164\n},\n{\n    title: Ascleâ€”A Python Natural Language Processing Toolkit for Medical Text Generation: Development and Evaluation Study,\n    abstract: Background Medical texts present significant domain-specific challenges, and manually curating these texts is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. To address this, natural language processing (NLP) algorithms have been developed to automate text processing. In the biomedical field, various toolkits for text processing exist, which have greatly improved the efficiency of handling unstructured text. However, these existing toolkits tend to emphasize different perspectives, and none of them offer generation capabilities, leaving a significant gap in the current offerings. Objective This study aims to describe the development and preliminary evaluation of Ascle. Ascle is tailored for biomedical researchers and clinical staff with an easy-to-use, all-in-one solution that requires minimal programming expertise. For the first time, Ascle provides 4 advanced and challenging generative functions: question-answering, text summarization, text simplification, and machine translation. In addition, Ascle integrates 12 essential NLP functions, along with query and search capabilities for clinical databases. Methods We fine-tuned 32 domain-specific language models and evaluated them thoroughly on 27 established benchmarks. In addition, for the question-answering task, we developed a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for large language models that incorporated a medical knowledge graph with ranking techniques to enhance the reliability of generated answers. Additionally, we conducted a physician validation to assess the quality of generated content beyond automated metrics. Results The fine-tuned models and RAG framework consistently enhanced text generation tasks. For example, the fine-tuned models improved the machine translation task by 20.27 in terms of BLEU score. In the question-answering task, the RAG framework raised the ROUGE-L score by 18% over the vanilla models. Physician validation of generated answers showed high scores for readability (4.95/5) and relevancy (4.43/5), with a lower score for accuracy (3.90/5) and completeness (3.31/5). Conclusions This study introduces the development and evaluation of Ascle, a user-friendly NLP toolkit designed for medical text generation. All code is publicly available through the Ascle GitHub repository.
