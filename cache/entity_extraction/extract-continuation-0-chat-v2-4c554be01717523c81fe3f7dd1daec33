Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have improved data processing in network management. However, existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG struggle with the complexity and implicit nature of semi-structured technical data, leading to inefficiencies in time, cost, and retrieval. This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data. FastRAG employs schema learning and script learning to extract and structure data without needing to submit entire data sources to an LLM. It integrates text search with knowledge graph (KG) querying to improve accuracy in retrieving context-rich information. Evaluation results demonstrate that FastRAG provides accurate question answering, while improving up to 90% in time and 85% in cost compared to Graph\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"GraphRAG Survey\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\"),\n{\n    title: \"GraphRAG Survey\",\n    publicationDate: \"2025-01-21\",\n    authors: [\"Qinggang Zhang\", \"Shengyuan Chen\", \"Yuan-Qi Bei\", \"Zheng Yuan\", \"Huachi Zhou\", \"Zijin Hong\", \"Junnan Dong\", \"Hao Chen\", \"Yi Chang\", \"Xiao Huang\"],\n    score: 70,\n    abstract: \"This survey analyzes the technical foundations of GraphRAG and examines current implementations across various professional domains, identifying key technical challenges and promising research directions.\",\n    methodology: \"The survey systematically analyzes the technical foundations of GraphRAG and evaluates its applications in different fields.\",\n    dataset: \"All related resources of GraphRAG are collected for the community at \\textcolor{blue}{\\url{https://github.com/DEEP-PolyU/Awesome-GraphRAG}}.\",\n    evaluation: \"The survey provides insights into the effectiveness and limitations of GraphRAG.\"\n},\n(\"FastRAG: Retrieval Augmented Generation for Semi-Structured Data\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\"),\n{\n    title: \"FastRAG\",\n    publicationDate: \"\",\n    authors: [\"authors' names\"],\n    score: \"\",\n    abstract: \"This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data.
