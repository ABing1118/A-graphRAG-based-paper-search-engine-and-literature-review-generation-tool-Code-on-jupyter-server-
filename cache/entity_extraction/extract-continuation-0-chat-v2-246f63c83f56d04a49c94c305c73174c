Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. The quality of constructed KGs may also impact the performance of some KG-dependent domains like GraphRAG systems and recommendation systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, there are still challenges when utilizing LLMs to address the task of generating structured KGs. And we have identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods. (1)There is a large amount of information and excessive noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2)Native LLMs struggle to effectively extract accuracy knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3)Hallucinations phenomenon cannot be overlooked when utilizing LLMs directly as an unsupervised method for constructing KGs.
