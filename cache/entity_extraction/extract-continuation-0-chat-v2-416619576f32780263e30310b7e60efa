We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

Previous research on multi-view retrieval often focused solely on different semantic forms of queries, neglecting the expression of specific domain knowledge perspectives. This paper introduces a novel multi-view RAG framework, MVRAG, tailored for knowledge-dense domains that utilizes intention-aware query rewriting from multiple domain viewpoints to enhance retrieval precision, thereby improving the effectiveness of the final inference. Experiments conducted on legal and medical case retrieval demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision rates with our framework. Our multi-perspective retrieval approach unleashes the potential of multi-view information enhancing RAG tasks, accelerating the further application of LLMs in knowledge-intensive fields.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-19,\n    authors: ['Guanhua Chen', 'Wenhan Yu', 'Lei Sha'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: ActiveRAG: Autonomously Knowledge Assimilation and Accommodation through Retrieval-Augmented Agents,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external knowledge, enhancing their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG models often treat LLMs as passive recipients of information, which can lead to interference from noisy retrieved content. In this paper, we introduce ActiveRAG, a multi-agent framework that mimics human learning behavior to help LLMs actively engage with and learn from retrieved evidence. ActiveRAG designs a knowledge assimilation agent to form the knowledge understanding by associating external knowledge with the parametric memory of LLMs. Then our model employs the thought accommodation agent to calibrate the internal thought of LLMs for response refinement. Our experiments show that ActiveRAG achieves a 10\\% improvement over vanilla RAG on various question-answering benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that ActiveRAG mitigates the impact of noisy retrievals, alleviates conflicts between external knowledge and parametric memory and improves the self-consistency of LLMs in answering the question.

LLMs are highly successful in understanding the subtleties of language and processing context by being trained on large datasets. However, the difficulties encountered in Information Retrieval (IR) processes have created an awareness that these models are not sufficient on their own. Traditional IR methods have generally been insufficient in understanding the complexity of natural language in responding to specific queries and retrieving appropriate information from documents or databases. Since this process is based only on keywords, it cannot fully capture the semantic meaning of the language. For this reason, it has been necessary to go beyond traditional IR methods for more precise information creation based on context and meaning. As a result of these requirements, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has come to the fore. RAG offers the ability to create richer and contextually meaningful answers to user queries by integrating LLMs with information retrieval processes. This architecture allows the language model to instantly access external information sources; thus, it generates more accurate and contextual responses armed with existing information. These features of RAG provide appropriate solutions to usersâ€™ information-based demands by better understanding the complexity of natural language. In this study, it is emphasized that the integration of RAG architecture with information retrieval systems and LLMs provides more\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"ActiveRAG: Autonomously Knowledge Assimilation and Accommodation through Retrieval-Augmented Agents\", \"Unlocking Multi-View Insights in Knowledge-Dense Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and LLM Integration\")"}]}
