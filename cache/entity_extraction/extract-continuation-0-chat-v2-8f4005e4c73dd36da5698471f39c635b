Return output in The two documents you've provided cover distinct areas of research in computer science and information retrieval, each with its own set of methodologies and applications.\n\n**Document 1**: This document focuses on the development of a technique called HybridRAG (Hybrid Retrieval and Generation) for improving question answering systems. The technique combines elements from vector databases and knowledge graphs to enhance both the retrieval accuracy and answer generation quality in question-answering tasks, particularly within financial domains. It demonstrates that by integrating context from both vector databases and knowledge graphs, it outperforms traditional methods like VectorRAG (which relies solely on vector databases) and GraphRAG (which uses knowledge graphs alone). The authors show improvements across retrieval accuracy and answer generation metrics.\n\n**Document 2**: This document is about the Computer Analysis of Images and Patterns conference held in Versailles, France. It covers a range of topics related to image processing, computer vision, pattern recognition, and their applications.

The present study, an investigation of factors related to the prevalence and intensity of math anxiety in college students, utilized 652 subjects obtained from two math courses and one psychology course at a large midwestern university. Results indicated that math anxiety occurs frequently among college students and that it is more likely to occur among women than among men arid among students with inadequate high school math backgrounds. Higher levels of math anxiety were related to lower mathematics achievement test scores, higher levels of test anxiety, and higher levels of trait anxiety. Implications for the identification and treatment of math-anxious students and for the process of educational/vocational counseling are discussed.,\n    publicationDate: 1978-01-01,\n    authors: ['N.

Using mathematical problem solving as a test bed, the authors demonstrate in 5 experiments that ST harms math problems that rely heavily on working memory resources--especially phonological aspects of this system. Moreover, by capitalizing on an understanding of the cognitive mechanisms by which ST exerts its impact, the authors show (a) how ST can be alleviated (e.g., by heavily practicing once-susceptible math problems such that they are\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"G.
