The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.

To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-01-24,\n    authors: ['Hang Luo', 'Jian Zhang', 'Chujun Li'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: A graph-based approach to closed-domain natural language generation,\n    abstract: Graph-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have seen significant advancements in recent years with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). LLMs are sophisticated models that recognize numerous NLP tasks by analyzing the users' natural language instructions called prompts. However, their industrial use is questionable due to such ethical concerns as false information generation called hallucinations, high risks of data breaches, and plagiarism. The paper introduces a novel NLP architecture, the Graph-Based Block-to-Block Generation (G3BG), which leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the power of attention mechanisms, distributional semantics, graph-based information retrieval, and decentralized networks. The model encodes user prompts to mitigate data breach risk, retrieves relevant information from a graph knowledge base, and forms a block for a conditional language model using LLMs to perform a new secure type\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"relationship\"<|>integrating knowledge graphs<|>Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG)<|>An effective solution to address challenges<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>traditional Graph RAG methods<|>simple graph traversal or semantic similarity<|>Do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>novel pipeline<|>filters large knowledge graphs<|>Emphasizes cause-effect edges<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>aligns retrieval process<|>chain-of-thought (CoT)<|>Model's internal reasoning steps<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>enhances reasoning<|>multi-stage path improvements<|>Improves logical grounding for complex queries<|>1)\n(\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"method\"),\n(\"traditional Graph RAG methods\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"cause-effect edges\", \"pipeline emphasis\"),\n(\"chain-of-thought (CoT)\", \"retrieval alignment\"),\n(\"multi-stage path improvements\", \"reasoning enhancement\"),\n(\"Large Language Models (LLMs)\", \"model type\"),\n(\"medical question-answering tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"up to a 10\\% absolute improvement\", \"experiment result\"),\n(\"Graph-Based Block-to-Block Generation (G3BG)\", \"novel NLP architecture\"),\n(\"state-of-the-art deep learning techniques\", \"G3BG leverages\"),\n(\"attention mechanisms\", \"G3BG component\"),\n(\"distributional semantics\", \"G3BG component\"),\n(\"graph-based information retrieval\", \"G3BG component\"),\n(\"decentralized networks\", \"G3BG component\"),\n(\"user prompts\", \"G3BG mitigation technique\"),\n(\"data breach risk\", \"G3BG mitigation context\"),\n(\"relevant information from a graph knowledge base\", \"G3BG retrieval process\"),\n(\"conditional language model using LLMs\", \"G3BG secure type\")"}]}
