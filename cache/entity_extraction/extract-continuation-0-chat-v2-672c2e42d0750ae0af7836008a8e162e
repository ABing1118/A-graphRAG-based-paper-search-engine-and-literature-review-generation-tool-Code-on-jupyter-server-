This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models.

To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.61% to 81.58% in open-ended text generation. Remarkably, our model also achieves the best performance and the lowest latency among several retrieval-augmented baselines. In conclusion, we assert that retrieval is more accurate generation and hope that our work will encourage further research on this new paradigm shift.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-02-27,\n    authors: ['Bowen Cao', 'Deng Cai', 'Leyang Cui', 'Xuxin Cheng', 'Wei Bi', 'Yuexian Zou', 'Shuming Shi'],\n    score: 96.87639203842082\n},\n{\n    title: README: Bridging Medical Jargon and Lay Understanding for Patient Education through Data-Centric NLP,\n    abstract: The advancement in healthcare has shifted focus toward patient-centric approaches, particularly in self-care and patient education, facilitated by access to Electronic Health Records (EHR).
