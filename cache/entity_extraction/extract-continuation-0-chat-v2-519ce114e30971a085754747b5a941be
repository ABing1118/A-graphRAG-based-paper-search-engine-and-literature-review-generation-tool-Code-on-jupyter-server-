Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: documents in RAG system while reducing data acquisition costs.

However, in knowledge-intensive domains, such as intangible cultural heritage, hallucination problems due to insufficient domain knowledge persist. To address this, we present ChatTf, a knowledge graph-enhanced intelligent Q&A system, exemplified by Chinese traditional folklore, aimed at reducing factuality hallucinations in this domain. Specifically, we constructed the Traditional Folklore Ontology (TFOnto) and proposed the Zero-shot Traditional Folklore Triplet Extraction (ZFTE) framework. Driven by TFOnto, ZFTE builds a Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG). We then proposed a dual-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG) based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models, mitigating factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks. In the experimental phase, ChatTf achieved an accuracy of 96.7%\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"relationship\"<|>documents<|>RAG system<|>Improves model's accuracy on two biomedical benchmarks while reducing data acquisition costs<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>LLM<|>dataset<|>Fine-tuned on a dataset comprising queries, retrieved documents, and their relevance scores generated by a pre-trained biomedical re-ranker to adapt the model for answering questions from reference documents<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>fine-tuned model<|>retrieved documents<|>Can independently score retrieved documents before answering the question, thereby more effectively utilizing the information contained within retrieved documents<|>1)\n(\"publicationDate\", \"date\"),\n(\"Yinkui Huang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Tianrun Gao\", \"author\"),\n(\"Jiangjiang Zhang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xiaohong Liu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Guangyu Wang\", \"author\"),\n(\"ChatTf: A Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Intelligent Q&A System for Mitigating Factuality Hallucinations in Traditional Folklore\", \"title\"),\n(\"Traditional Folklore Ontology (TFOnto)\", \"constructed knowledge base\"),\n(\"Zero-shot Traditional Folklore Triplet Extraction (ZFTE) framework\", \"proposed framework\"),\n(\"Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG)\", \"knowledge graph built by ZFTE framework\"),\n(\"Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG)\", \"framework proposed based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models\"),\n(\"factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks\", \"addressed problem\"),\n(\"accuracy of 96.7%\", \"achieved accuracy\")"}]}
