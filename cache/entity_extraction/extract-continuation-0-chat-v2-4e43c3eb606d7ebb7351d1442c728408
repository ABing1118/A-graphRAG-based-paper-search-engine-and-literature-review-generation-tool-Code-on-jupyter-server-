{"result": "To address this issue, you should implement a filtering mechanism during entity extraction that only includes entities matching the previously extracted types. Below is an example of how you might structure your code or process:\n\n```python\n# Assuming `extracted_entities` is a list containing all previously extracted entities and their types\n\ndef extract_and_filter_entities(text):\n    # Your entity extraction logic here, let's assume it returns a list of tuples (entity, type)\n    extracted = [(entity, 'type')]  # Placeholder for demonstration\n    \n    filtered_entities = []\n    \n    for entity, entity_type in extracted:\n        if entity_type in extracted_entities:  # Check if the type matches any previously extracted types\n            filtered_entities.append((entity, entity_type))\n            \n    return filtered_entities\n\n# Example usage:\n\n# Assuming `extracted_types` is a list of strings representing all previously extracted types\nextracted_types = ['Person', 'Location', 'Organization']\n\ntext_to_process = \"John Doe works at Google in California.\"\n\nfiltered_results = extract_and_filter_entities(text_to_process)\n\nprint(filtered_results)\n```\n\nIn this example, the function `extract_and_filter_entities` processes a given text and extracts entities. It then filters these entities based on whether their types match any of the previously extracted types stored in `extracted_types`. The result is a list of tuples containing only those entities that meet the criteria.\n\nRemember to replace the placeholder logic (`# Your entity extraction logic here`) with your actual entity extraction process, which could involve natural language processing techniques or regular expressions depending on your specific use case.", "input": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: 'Zhiqing Sun', 'Qian Liu', 'Jane Dwivedi-Yu', 'Yiming Yang', 'Jamie Callan', 'Graham Neubig'],\n    score: 147.89435276335314\n},\n{\n    title: Knowledge Graph Based Synthetic Corpus Generation for Knowledge-Enhanced Language Model Pre-training,\n    abstract: Prior work on Data-To-Text Generation, the task of converting knowledge graph (KG) triples into natural text, focused on domain-specific benchmark datasets. In this paper, however, we verbalize the entire English Wikidata KG, and discuss the unique challenges associated with a broad, open-domain, large-scale verbalization. We further show that verbalizing a comprehensive, encyclopedic KG like Wikidata can be used to integrate structured KGs and natural language corpora. In contrast to the many architectures that have been developed to integrate these two sources, our approach converts the KG into natural text, allowing it to be seamlessly integrated into existing language models. It carries the further advantages of improved factual accuracy and reduced toxicity in the resulting language model. We evaluate this approach by augmenting the retrieval corpus in a retrieval language model and showing significant improvements on the knowledge intensive tasks of open domain QA and the LAMA knowledge probe.,\n    publicationDate: 2021-06-01,\n    authors: ['Oshin Agarwal', 'Heming Ge', 'Siamak Shakeri', 'Rami Al-Rfou'],\n    score: 145.8436870802246\n},\n{\n    title: FiD-Light: Efficient and Effective Retrieval-Augmented Text Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation models offer many benefits over standalone language models: besides a textual answer to a given query they provide provenance items retrieved from an updateable knowledge base.
