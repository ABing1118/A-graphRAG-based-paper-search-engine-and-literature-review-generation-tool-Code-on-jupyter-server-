Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Driven by TFOnto, ZFTE builds a Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG). We then proposed a dual-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG) based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models, mitigating factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks. In the experimental phase, ChatTf achieved an accuracy of 96.7% on a self-built TFCQD test set, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods. This demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of folklore domain question answering.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Jun Xu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Haijing Zhang', 'Jiawei Lu', 'Gang Xiao'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: Investigating on the External Knowledge in RAG for Zero-Shot Cross-Language Transfer,\n    abstract: In the field of multilingual natural language processing (NLP), zero-shot cross-language transfer is an important research direction, which aims to enable models to effectively learn and reason without target language training data. This study explores the role of external knowledge in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to improve the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. This paper proposes a new model architecture that enriches the knowledge base of the RAG model by integrating external knowledge bases, thereby enhancing its information bridging capabilities between source and target languages. In the experimental section, this paper conducts experiments using multiple cross-language tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and text summarization, to evaluate the performancen and domain of the model in different languages. The experimental results indicate that introducing external knowledge sources significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the model, especially in resource-scarce language pairs. This research not only provides an effective solution for zero-shot cross-language transfer, but also provides new\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
