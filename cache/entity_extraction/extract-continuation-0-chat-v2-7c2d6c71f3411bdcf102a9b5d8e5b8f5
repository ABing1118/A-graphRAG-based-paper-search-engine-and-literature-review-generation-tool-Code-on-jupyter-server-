We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

Fine-tuning LLMs with external data is costly and resource-intensive. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) integrates relevant external information dynamically. We introduce GeneRAG, a frame-work that enhances LLMs’ gene-related capabilities using RAG and the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Evaluations with datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) show that GeneRAG outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with a 39% improvement in answering gene questions, a 43% performance increase in cell type annotation, and a 0.25 decrease in error rates for gene interaction prediction. These results highlight GeneRAG’s potential to bridge a critical gap in LLM capabilities for more effective applications in genetics.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-28,\n    authors: ['Xinyi Lin', 'Gelei Deng', 'Yuekang Li', 'Jingquan Ge', 'Joshua Wing Kei Ho', 'Yi Liu'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: KnowPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,\n    abstract: By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that large language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks. However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such as contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at achieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for constructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various error types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data ratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances. Experimental results show that KnowPO outperforms previous methods for handling knowledge conflicts by over 37\\%, while also exhibiting robust generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-06,\n    authors: ['Ruizhe Zhang', 'Yongxin Xu', 'Yuzhen Xiao', 'Runchuan Zhu', 'Xinke Jiang', 'Xu Chu', 'Junfeng Zhao', 'Yasha Wang'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: Supportiveness-based Knowledge Rewriting for Retrieval-augmented Language Modeling,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have recently shown great potential in mitigating the limitations of implicit knowledge in LLMs, such as untimely updating of the latest expertise and unreliable retention of long-tail knowledge. However, since the external knowledge base, as well as the retriever, can not guarantee reliability, potentially leading to the knowledge retrieved not being helpful or even misleading for LLM generation. In this paper, we introduce Supportiveness-based Knowledge Rewriting (SKR), a robust and pluggable knowledge rewriter inherently optimized for LLM generation. Specifically, we introduce the novel concept of\"supportiveness\"--which represents how effectively a knowledge piece facilitates downstream tasks--by considering the perplexity impact of augmented knowledge on the response text of a white-box LLM. Based on knowledge supportiveness, we first design a training data curation strategy for our rewriter model, effectively identifying and filtering out poor or irrelevant rewrites (e.g., with low supportiveness scores) to improve data efficacy. We then introduce the direct preference optimization (DPO) algorithm to align the generated rewrites to optimal supportiveness, guiding the rewriter model to summarize augmented content that better improves the final response. Comprehensive evaluations across six popular knowledge-intensive tasks and four LLMs have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of SKR. With only 7B parameters, SKR has shown better knowledge rewriting capability over G\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"GeneRAG: Enhancing Large Language Models with Gene-Related Task by Retrieval-Augmented Generation\", \"KnowPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\", \"Supportiveness-based Knowledge Rewriting for Retrieval-augmented Language Modeling\"),"}]}
