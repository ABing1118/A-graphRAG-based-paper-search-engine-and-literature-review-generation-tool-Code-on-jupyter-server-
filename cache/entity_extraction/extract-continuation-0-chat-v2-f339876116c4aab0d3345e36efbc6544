Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

However, existing RAG methods struggle with knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks, because useful information required to these tasks are badly scattered. This characteristic makes it difficult for existing RAG methods to accurately identify key information and perform global reasoning with such noisy augmentation. In this paper, motivated by the cognitive theories that humans convert raw information into various structured knowledge when tackling knowledge-intensive reasoning, we proposes a new framework, StructRAG, which can identify the optimal structure type for the task at hand, reconstruct original documents into this structured format, and infer answers based on the resulting structure. Extensive experiments across various knowledge-intensive tasks show that StructRAG achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly excelling in challenging scenarios, demonstrating its potential as an effective solution for enhancing LLMs in complex real-world applications.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-11,\n    authors: ['Zhuoqun Li', 'Xuanang Chen', 'Haiyang Yu', 'Hongyu Lin', 'Yaojie Lu', 'Qiaoyu Tang', 'Fei Huang', 'Xianpei Han', 'Le Sun', 'Yongbin Li\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"StructRAG\", \"title\"),\n(\"Boosting Knowledge Intensive Reasoning of LLMs via Inference-time Hybrid Information Structurization\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\", \"key means to enhance large language models in knowledge-based tasks\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive reasoning tasks\", \"challenges faced by existing RAG methods\"),\n(\"useful information scattered across tasks\", \"difficulty for existing RAG methods in identifying key information and performing global reasoning\"),\n(\"hybrid information structurization\", \"proposed solution by StructRAG framework\"),\n(\"cognitive theories\", \"inspiration behind the StructRAG framework\"),\n(\"task-specific structure identification\", \"ability of StructRAG to identify optimal structure type for each task\"),\n(\"document reconstruction into structured format\", \"process involved in StructRAG's approach\"),\n(\"answer inference based on resulting structure\", \"methodology used by StructRAG for generating answers\"),\n(\"state-of-the-art performance across various tasks\", \"excellence demonstrated by StructRAG\"),\n(\"challenging scenarios\", \"StructRAG's capability to handle complex real-world applications\"),\n(\"enhancing LLMs in knowledge-intensive reasoning\", \"potential of StructRAG as a solution for improving large language models\"),\n(\"knowledge-based tasks\", \"application areas targeted by StructRAG\"),\n(\"Zhuoqun Li\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xuanang Chen\", \"author\"),\n(\"Haiyang Yu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Hongyu Lin\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yaojie Lu\", \"author\"),\n(\"Qiaoyu Tang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Fei Huang\", \"author\"),\n(\"Xianpei Han\", \"author\"),\n(\"Le Sun\", \"author\"),\n(\"Yongbin Li\", \"additional author\")"}]}
