Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: face problems when it comes to having transparent decision-making processes or updating their world knowledge. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system by improving the Mistral7B model specifically for RAG tasks. The novel training technique includes Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) which enables efficient adaptation of large pre- trained models on-the-fly according to task-specific requirements while reducing computational costs. In addition, this system combines pre-trained embedding models that use pre-trained cross-encoders for effective retrieval and reranking of information. This RAG system will thus leverage these state-of-the-art methodologies towards achieving top performances in a range of NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-12,\n    authors: ['M.

This paper discusses a retrieval-intensive context of use, whose intended output is the generation of narrative explanations in a non-bona-fide, entertainment mode subject to heavy intertextuality and strictly constrained by culture-bound poetic conventions. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system\", \"title\"),\n(\"Mistral7B model\", \"model\"),\n(\"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\", \"training technique\"),\n(\"large pre-trained models\", \"task adaptation method\"),\n(\"computational costs reduction\", \"benefit of PEFT\"),\n(\"pre-trained embedding models\", \"information retrieval component\"),\n(\"pre-trained cross-encoders\", \"retrieval and reranking tool\"),\n(\"question answering\", \"NLP task performance benchmark\"),\n(\"summarization\", \"NLP task performance benchmark\"),\n(\"M.
