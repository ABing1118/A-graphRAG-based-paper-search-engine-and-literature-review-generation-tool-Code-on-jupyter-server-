Identify and extract all the entities that match the types above. For each identified entity, gather:\n   - entity_name: The exact text of the entity, capitalized if it’s a title or a name.\n   - entity_type: Must be one of [paper_title, author, publication_date, abstract].\n   - entity_description: A concise description of the entity’s role or content.\n   Format for each identified entity:\n   (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. Among the identified entities, find any pairs (source_entity, target_entity) that have a *clear and direct* relationship in the text. For each such relationship, gather:\n   - source_entity: the entity_name (step 1) for the first entity\n   - target_entity: the entity_name (step 1) for the second entity\n   - relationship_description: a short explanation why these two entities are related\n   - relationship_strength: integer from 1 to 10 (the stronger the connection, the higher the number)\n   Format for each relationship:\n   (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. After finishing steps 1 and 2, output the results as a single list in text form, using **##** as the delimiter between records. That means each entity or relationship is one record, separated by **##**. No JSON, just plain text with these custom tuple delimiters and record delimiters.\n\n4.
