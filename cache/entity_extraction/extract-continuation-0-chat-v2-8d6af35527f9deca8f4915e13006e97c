Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: ', 'Nan Hu', 'Wanqiu Long', 'Jiaoyan Chen', 'Jeff Z.

The powerful generator still tends to generate content even when the LLM does not have sufficient knowledge at all, which is known as the hallucination problem. We find there is a research void in applying LLMs in the vocal training industry, which requires intensive expert knowledge in any chatbot or intelligent tutor services. This paper details employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to develop a domain-specific language model, addressing inherent challenges such as hallucination, where large models generate plausible but inaccurate content, and lack of domain specificity. By segmenting the knowledge base and establishing semantic similarities between user queries and knowledge data, the project lays a solid foundation for integrating RAG, significantly improving response accuracy and contextual relevance. The report highlights the successful implementation of RAG, enhancing system intelligence and personalization for user-specific needs, discusses challenges and solutions during the implementation process, and outlines future directions to expand RAG capabilities and improve user experiences.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-16,\n    authors: ['Chun-hung Jonas Leung', 'Yicheng Yi', 'Le Kuai', 'Zongxi Li', 'Siu-Kei Au Yeung', 'Kwok-wah John Lee', 'Ka-him Kelvin Ho', 'Kevin Hung'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Distill-SynthKG: Distilling Knowledge Graph Synthesis Workflow for Improved Coverage and Efficiency,\n    abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) generated by large language models (LLMs\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"relationship\"<|>Nan Hu<|>authors<|>作者之一, 在语音训练领域研究中贡献了力量<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Wanqiu Long<|>authors<|>作者之一, 在语音训练领域研究中贡献了力量<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Jiaoyan Chen<|>authors<|>作者之一, 在语音训练领域研究中贡献了力量<|>1)\n(\"relationship\"<|>Jeff Z.
