We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: publicationDate: 2024-05-04,\n    authors: ['Taolin Zhang', 'Dongyang Li', 'Qizhou Chen', 'Chengyu Wang', 'Longtao Huang', 'Hui Xue', 'Xiaofeng He', 'Junyuan Huang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: W-RAG: Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering,\n    abstract: In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge. To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component. Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation. In this paper, we propose W-RAG by utilizing the ranking capabilities of LLMs to create weakly labeled data for training dense retrievers. Specifically, we rerank the top-$K$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that LLMs will generate the correct answer based on the question and each passage. The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive training examples for dense retrieval. Our comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-15,\n    authors: ['Jinming Nian', 'Zhiyuan Peng', 'Qifan Wang', 'Yi Fang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: ClimRetrieve: A Benchmarking Dataset for Information Retrieval from Corporate Climate Disclosures,\n    abstract: To handle the vast amounts of qualitative data produced in corporate climate communication, stakeholders increasingly\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"W-RAG\", \"title\"),\n(\"Weakly Supervised Dense Retrieval in RAG for Open-domain Question Answering\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"In knowledge-intensive tasks such as open-domain question answering (OpenQA), Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to generate factual answers relying solely on their internal (parametric) knowledge.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this limitation, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems enhance LLMs by retrieving relevant information from external sources, thereby positioning the retriever as a pivotal component.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Although dense retrieval demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, its training poses challenges due to the scarcity of ground-truth evidence, largely attributed to the high costs of human annotation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"In this paper, we propose W-RAG by utilizing the ranking capabilities of LLMs to create weakly labeled data for training dense retrievers.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Specifically, we rerank the top-$K$ passages retrieved via BM25 by assessing the probability that LLMs will generate the correct answer based on the question and each passage.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"The highest-ranking passages are then used as positive training examples for dense retrieval.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our comprehensive experiments across four publicly available OpenQA datasets demonstrate that our approach enhances both retrieval and OpenQA performance compared to baseline models.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"ClimRetrieve\", \"title\"),\n(\"A Benchmarking Dataset for Information Retrieval from Corporate Climate Disclosures\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To handle the vast amounts of qualitative data produced in corporate climate communication, stakeholders increasingly\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"The publicationDate field contains a date format that is not consistent with the others.\", \"format inconsistency\"),\n(\"The authors field lists multiple authors for each paper, which might be an error or intended to include all contributors.\", \"author list inconsistency\"),\n(\"The score field has the same value (70) for both papers, suggesting either a mistake in recording or a common metric used across publications.\", \"score inconsistency\")"}]}
