However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such as contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at achieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for constructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various error types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data ratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances. Experimental results show that KnowPO outperforms previous methods for handling knowledge conflicts by over 37\\%, while also exhibiting robust generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-06,\n    authors: ['Ruizhe Zhang', 'Yongxin Xu', 'Yuzhen Xiao', 'Runchuan Zhu\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"KnowPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models\", \"Research Topic\", \"Methodology\", \"Dataset\", \"Evaluation\")\n\n{\n    title: \"KnowPO\",\n    publicationDate: \"2024-08-06\",\n    authors: [\"Ruizhe Zhang\", \"Yongxin Xu\", \"Yuzhen Xiao\", \"Runchuan Zhu\"],\n    score: null,\n    abstract: \"By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that large language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks.
