Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models. Finally, we discuss key future directions for applying knowledge-graphs-empowered RAG frameworks in networking, including robust updates, mitigation of hallucination, and enhanced security measures for networking applications.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-10,\n    authors: ['Yang Xiong', 'Ruichen Zhang', 'Yinqiu Liu', 'D.
