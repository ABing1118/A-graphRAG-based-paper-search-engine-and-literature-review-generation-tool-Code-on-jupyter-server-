Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive creation of training labels for each resource. In contrast, LLMs have exhibited strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks. We hypothesise that in the context of federated search LLMs can assess the relevance of resources without the need for extensive predefined labels or features. In this paper, we propose ReSLLM. Our ReSLLM method exploits LLMs to drive the selection of resources in federated search in a zero-shot setting. In addition, we devise an unsupervised fine tuning protocol, the Synthetic Label Augmentation Tuning (SLAT), where the relevance of previously logged queries and snippets from resources is predicted using an off-the-shelf LLM and then in turn used to fine-tune ReSLLM with respect to resource selection. Our empirical evaluation and analysis details the factors influencing the effectiveness of LLMs in this context. The results showcase the merits of ReSLLM for resource selection: not only competitive effectiveness in the zero-shot setting, but also obtaining large when fine-tuned using SLAT-protocol.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-01-31,\n    authors: ['Shuai Wang', 'Shengyao Zhuang', 'B.

Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
