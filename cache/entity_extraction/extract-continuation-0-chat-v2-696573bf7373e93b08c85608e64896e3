We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: internal knowledge, (2) assess the quality of retrieved documents, and (3) enhance the model’s ability to utilize context.

We introduce an iterative approach where the search engine generates retrieval results for these RAG agents and gathers feedback on the quality of the retrieved documents during an offline phase. This feedback is then used to iteratively optimize the search engine using a novel expectation-maximization algorithm, with the goal of maximizing each agent's utility function. Additionally, we adapt this approach to an online setting, allowing the search engine to refine its behavior based on real-time individual agents feedback to better serve the results for each of them. Experiments on diverse datasets from the Knowledge-Intensive Language Tasks (KILT) benchmark demonstrates that our approach significantly on average outperforms competitive baselines across 18 RAG models. We also demonstrate that our method effectively ``personalizes'' the retrieval process for each RAG agent based on the collected feedback. Finally, we provide a comprehensive ablation study to explore various aspects of our method.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-13,\n    authors: ['Alireza Salemi', 'Hamed Zamani'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: RAVEN: Multitask Retrieval Augmented Vision-Language Learning,\n    abstract: The scaling of large language models to encode all the world's knowledge in model parameters is unsustainable and has exacerbated resource barriers. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) presents a potential solution, yet its application to vision-language models (VLMs) is under explored. Existing methods focus on models designed for single tasks. Furthermore, they're limited by the need for resource intensive pre training, additional parameter requirements, unaddressed modality prioritization and lack of clear benefit over non-retrieval baselines. This paper introduces RAVEN, a multitask retrieval augmented VLM framework that enhances base VLMs through efficient, task specific fine-tuning. By integrating retrieval augmented samples without the need for additional retrieval-specific parameters, we show that the model acquires retrieval properties that are effective across multiple tasks. Our results and extensive ablations across retrieved modalities for the image captioning and VQA tasks indicate significant performance improvements compared to non retrieved baselines +1 CIDEr on MSCOCO, +4 CIDEr on NoCaps and nearly a +3\\% accuracy on specific VQA question types. This underscores the efficacy of applying RAG approaches to VLMs, marking a stride toward more efficient and accessible multimodal learning.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-27,\n    authors: ['Varun Nagaraj Rao', 'Siddharth Choudhary', 'Aditya Deshpande', 'R.

While recent methods have integrated RAG with chain-of-thought reasoning or test-time search using Process Reward Models (PRMs), these approaches encounter challenges such as a lack of explanations, bias in PRM training data, early-step bias in PRM scores, and insufficient post-training optimization of reasoning potential. To address these issues, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Reasoning through Trustworthy Process Rewarding (ReARTeR), a framework that enhances RAG systems' reasoning capabilities through post-training and test-time scaling. At test time, ReARTeR introduces Trustworthy Process Rewarding via a Process Reward Model for accurate scalar scoring and a Process Explanation Model (PEM) for generating natural language explanations, enabling step refinement. During post-training, it utilizes Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by Trustworthy Process Rewarding to collect high-quality step-level preference data, optimized through Iterative Preference Optimization.
