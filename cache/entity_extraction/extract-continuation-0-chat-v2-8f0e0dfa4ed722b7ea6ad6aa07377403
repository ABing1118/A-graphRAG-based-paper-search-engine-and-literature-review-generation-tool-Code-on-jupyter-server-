The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

Specifically, we study the key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA) with three categories: LLM-based graph query processing (LLM-GQP), LLM-based graph inference and learning (LLM-GIL), and graph-LLM-based applications. LLM-GQP focuses on an integration of graph analytics techniques and LLM prompts, including graph understanding and knowledge graph (KG) based augmented retrieval, while LLM-GIL focuses on learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning and graph representation. We summarize the useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks. Moreover, we give a summary of LLM model evaluation, benchmark datasets/tasks, and a deep pro and cons analysis of LLM models. We also explore open problems and future directions in this exciting interdisciplinary research area of LLMs and graph analytics.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-23,\n    authors: ['Wenbo Shang', 'Xin Huang'],\n    score: 102.95836866004329\n},\n{\n    title: FIT-RAG: Black-Box RAG with Factual Information and Token Reduction,\n    abstract: Due to the extraordinarily large number of parameters, fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge is impractical in lots of applications. To avoid fine-tuning, we can alternatively treat a LLM as a black-box (i.e., freeze the parameters of the LLM) and augment it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, namely black-box RAG. Recently, black-box RAG has achieved success in knowledge-intensive tasks and has gained much attention. Existing black-box RAG methods typically fine-tune the retriever to cater to LLMs’ preferences and concatenate all the retrieved documents\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"LLM-GGA\", \"title\"),\n(\"key problems of LLM-based generative graph analytics (LLM-GGA)\", \"study focus\"),\n(\"graph understanding and knowledge graph (KG) based augmented retrieval\", \"LLM-GQP task\"),\n(\"learning and reasoning over graphs, including graph learning, graph-formed reasoning and graph representation\", \"LLM-GIL task\"),\n(\"useful prompts incorporated into LLM to handle different graph downstream tasks\", \"prompt incorporation\"),\n(\"summary of LLM model evaluation\", \"model evaluation summary\"),\n(\"benchmark datasets/tasks\", \"evaluation benchmarks\"),\n(\"deep pro and cons analysis of LLM models\", \"model analysis\"),\n(\"open problems and future directions in this exciting interdisciplinary research area of LLMs and graph analytics\", \"research outlook\"),\n(\"fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) to update long-tail or out-of-date knowledge\", \"alternative approach for updating knowledge\"),\n(\"treating a LLM as a black-box\", \"black-box treatment of LLM\"),\n(\"augmenting with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system\", \"RAG system integration\"),\n(\"black-box RAG\", \"methodology\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"task application context\"),\n(\"avoid fine-tuning\", \"alternative to fine-tuning\"),\n(\"treating a LLM as a black-box and augmenting it with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system\", \"black-box RAG approach\")"}]}
