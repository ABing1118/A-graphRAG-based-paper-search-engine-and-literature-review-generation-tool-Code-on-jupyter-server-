function is not learned optimally discriminative with respect to the unseen classes, where discerning among them leads to the target task. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to adapt the instance embeddings to the target classification task with a set-to-set function, yielding embeddings that are task-specific and are discriminative. We empirically investigated various instantiations of such set-to-set functions and observed the Transformer is most effective --- as it naturally satisfies key properties of our desired model. We denote this model as FEAT (few-shot embedding adaptation w/ Transformer) and validate it on both the standard few-shot classification benchmark and four extended few-shot learning settings with essential use cases, i.e., cross-domain, transductive, generalized few-shot learning, and low-shot learning. It archived consistent improvements over baseline models as well as previous methods, and established the new state-of-the-art results on two benchmarks.,\n    publicationDate: 2018-12-10,\n    authors: ['Han-Jia Ye', 'Hexiang Hu', 'De-chuan Zhan', 'Fei Sha'],\n    score: 161.42157909026895\n},\n{\n    title: TransVG: End-to-End Visual Grounding with Transformers,\n    abstract: In this paper, we present a neat yet effective transformer-based framework for visual grounding, namely TransVG, to address the task of grounding a language query to the corresponding region onto an image. The state-of-the-art methods, including two-stage or one-stage ones, rely on a complex module with manually-designed mechanisms to perform the query reasoning and multi-modal fusion. However, the involvement of certain mechanisms in fusion module design, such as query decomposition and image scene graph, makes the models easily overfit to datasets with specific scenarios, and limits the plenitudinous interaction between the visual-linguistic context. To avoid this caveat, we propose to establish the multi-modal correspondence by leveraging transformers, and\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"transfer learning\" \"task-agnostic\" \"embedding function\" \"unseen classes\" \"target task\" \"instance embeddings\" \"set-to-set function\" \"task-specific\" \"discriminative\" \"Transformer\" \"FEAT (few-shot embedding adaptation w/ Transformer)\" \"standard few-shot classification benchmark\" \"cross-domain\" \"transductive\" \"generalized few-shot learning\" \"low-shot learning\" \"baseline models\" \"state-of-the-art results\")\n(\"2018-12-10\" \"Han-Jia Ye\" \"Hexiang Hu\" \"De-chuan Zhan\" \"Fei Sha\" \"161.42157909026895\")\n(\"visual grounding\" \"TransVG\" \"transformer-based framework\" \"language query\" \"region on image\" \"state-of-the-art methods\" \"two-stage or one-stage ones\" \"query reasoning\" \"multi-modal fusion\" \"query decomposition\" \"image scene graph\" \"overfitting to datasets\" \"specific scenarios\" \"plenitudinous interaction\" \"visual-linguistic context\")\n"}]}
