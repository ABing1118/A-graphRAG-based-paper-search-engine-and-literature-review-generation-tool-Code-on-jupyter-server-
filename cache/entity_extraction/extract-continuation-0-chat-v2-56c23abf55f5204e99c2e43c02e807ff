RAG expands the query context by incorporating external knowledge bases to enhance the response accuracy. However, it would be inefficient to access LLMs multiple times for each query and unreliable to retrieve all the relevant documents by a single query. We have found that even though there is low relevance between some critical documents and query, it is possible to retrieve the remaining documents by combining parts of the documents with the query. To mine the relevance, a two-stage retrieval framework called Dynamic-Relevant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DR-RAG) is proposed to improve document retrieval recall and the accuracy of answers while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, a compact classifier is applied to two different selection strategies to determine the contribution of the retrieved documents to answering the query and retrieve the relatively relevant documents. Meanwhile, DR-RAG call the LLMs only once, which significantly improves the efficiency of the experiment. The experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets show that DR-RAG can significantly improve the accuracy of the answers and achieve new progress in QA systems.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 3,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-06-11\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305682244\",\n        \"name\": \"Zijian Hei\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305742427\",\n        \"name\": \"Weiling Liu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"46223131\",\n        \"name\": \"Wenjie Ou\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305681770\",\n        \"name\": \"Juyi Qiao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305663892\",\n        \"name\": \"Junming Jiao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305665203\",\n        \"name\": \"Guowen Song\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2306947084\",\n        \"name\": \"Ting Tian\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2306954967\",\n        \"name\": \"Yi Lin\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 90.79441541679836\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"915539c51252649cf7d09e25dea3af199235ebed\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/915539c51252649cf7d09e25dea3af199235ebed\",\n    \"title\": \"Adaptive Contrastive Decoding in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The provided papers discuss advancements in the field of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and large language models (LLMs), particularly focusing on improving question-answering systems.
