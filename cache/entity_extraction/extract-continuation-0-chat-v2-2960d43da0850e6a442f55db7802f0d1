Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation. For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"Retrieval is Accurate Generation\", \"title\"),\n(\"Standard language models generate text by selecting tokens from a fixed, finite, and standalone vocabulary.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"For instance, compared to the standard language model counterpart, our model raises the accuracy from 23.47% to 36.27% on OpenbookQA, and improves the MAUVE score from 42.\", \"abstract\"),\n(\"Our model\", \"subject\"),\n(\"standard language models\", \"comparison\"),\n(\"context-aware phrases\", \"novel method\"),\n(\"training oracles\", \"determining challenge\"),\n(\"linguistic heuristics\", \"initialization technique\"),\n(\"iterative self-reinforcement\", \"bootstrap process\"),\n(\"knowledge-intensive tasks\", \"performance benchmark\"),\n(\"open-ended text generation\", \"quality improvement context\"),\n(\"accuracy on OpenbookQA\", \"specific task performance\"),\n(\"MAUVE score\", \"generation quality metric\")\n#############################\n\n\n\n-Real Data-\n######################\ntext: valuable tool for enhancing performance and understanding of complex textual data.

Recently, RAG-end2end model further optimized the architecture and achieved notable performance improvements on domain adaptation. However, the effectiveness of these RAG-based architectures remains relatively unexplored when fine-tuned on specialized domains such as customer service for building a reliable conversational AI system. Furthermore, a critical challenge persists in reducing the occurrence of hallucinations while maintaining high domain-specific accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the performance of diverse RAG and RAG-like architectures through domain adaptation and evaluated their ability to generate accurate and relevant response grounded in the contextual knowledge base. To facilitate the evaluation of the models, we constructed a novel dataset HotelConvQA, sourced from wide range of hotel-related conversations and fine-tuned all the models on our domain specific dataset. We also addressed a critical research gap on determining the impact of domain adaptation on reducing hallucinations across different RAG architectures, an aspect that was not properly measured in prior work. Our evaluation shows positive results in all metrics by employing domain adaptation, demonstrating strong performance on QA tasks and providing insights into their efficacy in reducing hallucinations. Our findings clearly indicate that domain adaptation not only enhances the models' performance on QA tasks but also significantly reduces hallucination across all evaluated RAG architectures.,\n    publicationDate: 2024\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"valuable tool\", \"description\"),\n(\"enhancing performance and understanding of complex textual data\", \"function\"),\n(\"CKGC’s transformative potential\", \"impact\"),\n(\"unlocking insights from vast text corpora\", \"application\"),\n(\"more intelligent and context-aware information retrieval systems\", \"goal\"),\n\n(\"Leveraging the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation Models for Question Answering and Reducing Hallucination\", \"title\"),\n(\"Large Language Models\", \"context\"),\n(\"highly effective on downstream applications like Question Answering\", \"specific application\"),\n(\"RAG-end2end model\", \"model\"),\n(\"notable performance improvements on domain adaptation\", \"achievement\"),\n(\"domain-specific domains such as customer service\", \"target domain\"),\n(\"reliable conversational AI system\", \"aim\"),\n(\"occurrence of hallucinations\", \"challenge\"),\n(\"high domain-specific accuracy\", \"requirement\"),\n(\"diverse RAG and RAG-like architectures\", \"investigated models\"),\n(\"performance across different metrics\", \"evaluation criteria\"),\n(\"HotelConvQA dataset\", \"constructed dataset\"),\n(\"fine-tuned on our domain specific dataset\", \"training process\"),\n(\"critical research gap\", \"addressed issue\"),\n(\"reducing hallucinations\", \"improvement goal\"),\n(\"strong performance on QA tasks\", \"positive outcome\"),\n(\"insights into their efficacy in reducing hallucinations\", \"findings\"),\n(\"enhances the models' performance on QA tasks\", \"performance enhancement\"),\n(\"significantly reduces hallucination across all evaluated RAG architectures\", \"hallucination reduction\"),\n(\"clearly indicate that domain adaptation\", \"conclusion\"),\n(\"CKGC’s transformative potential\", \"relevance to text corpora analysis\"),\n(\"more intelligent and context-aware information retrieval systems\", \"future direction\")\n\n\n\n- Final Output Format -\nvaluable tool for enhancing performance and understanding of complex textual data.
