Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

We introduce a novel method that selects context-aware phrases from a collection of supporting documents. One of the most significant challenges for this paradigm shift is determining the training oracles, because a string of text can be segmented in various ways and each segment can be retrieved from numerous possible documents. To address this, we propose to initialize the training oracles using linguistic heuristics and, more importantly, bootstrap the oracles through iterative self-reinforcement. Extensive experiments show that our model not only outperforms standard language models on a variety of knowledge-intensive tasks but also demonstrates improved generation quality in open-ended text generation.

However, existing RAG models often treat LLMs as passive recipients of information, which can lead to interference from noisy retrieved content. In this paper, we introduce ActiveRAG, a multi-agent framework that mimics human learning behavior to help LLMs actively engage with and learn from retrieved evidence. ActiveRAG designs a knowledge assimilation agent to form the knowledge understanding by associating external knowledge with the parametric memory of LLMs. Then our model employs the thought accommodation agent to calibrate the internal thought of LLMs for response refinement. Our experiments show that ActiveRAG achieves a 10\\% improvement over vanilla RAG on various question-answering benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that ActiveRAG mitigates the impact of noisy retrievals, alleviates conflicts between external knowledge and parametric memory and improves the self-consistency of LLMs in answering the question.
