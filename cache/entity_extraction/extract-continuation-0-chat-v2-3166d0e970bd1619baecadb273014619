The GraphRAG approach represents a significant advance in retrieving and summarizing archival case documents. It deals with the difficulties of accessing relevant legal information with inherent complexities. Further, it improves the efficiency of information retrieval by using graphical representations of legal texts. It enables lawyers to navigate the complex relationships between cases, statutes, and legal principles. The framework facilitates extracting relevant information and incorporates advanced natural language processing techniques for efficient summarization. It enables users to understand key legal concepts quickly. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and focusing on user-centered design, GraphRAG can significantly improve access to legal information, thereby meeting the growing needs of the legal community. This paper proposes a graph-rag-based approach for multilingual legal information retrieval (ML2IR), focusing on the Burmese language. Our graph-rag-based approach addresses the hallucination problem, crucial in legal information retrieval.
