However, without effectively utilizing such knowledge, solely expanding context does not always enhance performance. In this work, we investigate inference scaling for retrieval augmented generation (RAG), exploring strategies beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge. We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate R\n------------------------\noutput:\n(\"relationship\"<|>external knowledge<|>RAG<|>Utilizing external knowledge can enhance performance in retrieval augmented generation (RAG)<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>in-context learning<|>RAG<|>In-context learning provides additional flexibility to scale test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>iterative prompting<|>RAG<|>Iterative prompting offers another strategy beyond simply increasing the quantity of knowledge in scaling inference for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>retrieved documents<|>RAG<|>Increasing retrieved documents can enhance LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information during test-time computation<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>generation steps<|>RAG<|>Increasing generation steps provides additional flexibility in scaling test-time computation for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>optimal configuration<|>RAG performance<|>The scaling of inference computation benefits RAG performance when optimally configured<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>budget allocation<|>optimal test-time compute<|>We can predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>nearly linear gains<|>inference scaling laws<|>Increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, describing the inference scaling laws for RAG<|>2)\n(\"relationship\"<|>computation allocation model<|>RAG<|>We develop a computation allocation model to estimate RAG's performance based on different inference parameters and budget allocations<|>2)\n#############################\n\n\nExample 2:\n\ntext:\n\",\n    \"score\": 94.1415686865115\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\",\n    \"title\": \"Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) enhances the accuracy and reliability of generative AI models by sourcing factual information from external databases, which is extensively employed in document-grounded question-answering (QA) tasks.

Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs that encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in real-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of non-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user satisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit enhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse capabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within this framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The system utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by selecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the historical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while achieving state-of-the-art performance in stationary environments.
