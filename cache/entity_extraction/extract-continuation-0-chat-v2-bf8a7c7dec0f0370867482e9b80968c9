This paper introduces the RAG framework that integrates knowledge graphs in its database and explores such framework's application in networking. We begin by exploring RAG's applications in networking and the limitations of conventional RAG and present the advantages that knowledge graphs' structured knowledge representation brings to the retrieval and generation processes. Next, we propose a detailed GraphRAG-based framework for networking, including a step-by-step tutorial on its construction. Our evaluation through a case study on channel gain prediction demonstrates GraphRAG's enhanced capability in generating accurate, contextually rich responses, surpassing traditional RAG models.
