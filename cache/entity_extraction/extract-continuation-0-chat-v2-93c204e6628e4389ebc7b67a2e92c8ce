For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) – it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 → 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2022,\n    \"citationCount\": 35,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": {\n      \"url\": \"http://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.16773\",\n      \"status\": \"GREEN\"\n    },\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2022-10-30\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": null,\n        \"name\": \"Yuxiang Wu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2155474139\",\n        \"name\": \"Yu Zhao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"33968873\",\n        \"name\": \"Baotian Hu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"3051815\",\n        \"name\": \"Pasquale Minervini\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"1918552\",\n        \"name\": \"Pontus Stenetorp\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"48662861\",\n        \"name\": \"Sebastian Riedel\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 123.75278407684165\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"46f9f7b8f88f72e12cbdb21e3311f995eb6e65c5\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/46f9f7b8f88f72e12cbdb21e3311f995eb6e65c5\",\n    \"title\": \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Large Language Models: A Survey\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) showcase impressive capabilities but encounter challenges like hallucination, outdated knowledge, and non-transparent, untraceable reasoning processes.
