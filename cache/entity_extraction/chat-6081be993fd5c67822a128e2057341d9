It creates synthetic training data to fine-tune lightweight LM judges and uses a small set of human-annotated datapoints for prediction-powered inference. The framework accurately evaluates RAG systems with minimal human annotations and remains effective across domain shifts.\n\n2. **Title:** ARE\n   - **Authors:** Youna Kim, Hyuhng Joon Kim, Cheonbok Park, Choonghyun Park, Hyunsoo Cho, Junyeob Kim, Kang Min Yoo, Sang-goo Lee, Taeuk Kim\n   - **Year:** 2024\n   - **Score:** 80.397\n   - **Abstract Summary:** This paper is incomplete and does not provide a full title or abstract summary.\n\n3. **Title:** CR\n   - **Authors:** Not provided in the JSON data.\n   - **Year:** Not provided in the JSON data.\n   - **Score:** Not provided in the JSON data.\n   - **Abstract Summary:** The title \"CR\" is incomplete and does not provide a full abstract summary.\n\nGiven the incomplete nature of the third paper, here's what we can summarize from the first two papers:\n\n- **ARES: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems**\n  - Authors: Jon Saad-Falcon, O.

Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into English, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\ntext:\narXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 16,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n

Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLMs with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines, especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval-augmented generation.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 1,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-08-02\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2189657321\",\n        \"name\": \"Youna Kim\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2166352356\",\n        \"name\": \"Hyuhng Joon Kim\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2284731913\",\n        \"name\": \"Cheonbok Park\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2188345697\",\n        \"name\": \"Choonghyun Park\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2259114784\",\n        \"name\": \"Hyunsoo Cho\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2109166096\",\n        \"name\": \"Junyeob Kim\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"31760501\",\n        \"name\": \"Kang Min Yoo\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2261393515\",\n        \"name\": \"Sang-goo Lee\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"5041757\",\n        \"name\": \"Taeuk Kim\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 80.39720770839918\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"4df2b1e7d54fe5ad81dc2ed6774b93ef7891b3c8\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4df2b1e7d54fe5ad81dc2ed6774b93ef7891b3c8\",\n    \"title\": \"ARES: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems traditionally relies on hand annotations for input queries, passages to retrieve, and responses to generate. We introduce ARES, an Automated RAG Evaluation System, for evaluating RAG systems along the dimensions of context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. By creating its own synthetic training data, ARES finetunes lightweight LM judges to assess the quality of individual RAG components. To mitigate potential prediction errors, ARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated datapoints for prediction-powered inference (PPI). Across eight different knowledge-intensive tasks in KILT, SuperGLUE, and AIS, ARES accurately evaluates RAG systems while using only a few hundred human annotations during evaluation. Furthermore, ARES judges remain effective across domain shifts, proving accurate even after changing the type of queries and/or documents used in the evaluated RAG systems.
