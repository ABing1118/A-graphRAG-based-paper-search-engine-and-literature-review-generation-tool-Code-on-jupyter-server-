Entity: \"Dr. Smith\"\n   Type: Person\n   Context: The document refers to a medical professional by this name, which seems to have been missed in the extraction process.\n\n4. Relationship: \"Product X is manufactured by Company Y\"\n   Type: Manufacturing Relation\n   Context: This relationship was not detected because it wasn't explicitly stated as such during the extraction phase.\n```\n\nPlease replace the placeholders (`# Missing Entities`, `Type`, and `Context`) with your actual data, and adjust the entities and relationships according to your specific case.", "input": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
