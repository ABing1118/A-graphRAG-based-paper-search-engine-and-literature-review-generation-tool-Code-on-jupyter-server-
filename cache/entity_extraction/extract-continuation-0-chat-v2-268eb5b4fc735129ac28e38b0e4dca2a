However, RAG fails on global questions directed at an entire text corpus, such as\"What are the main themes in the dataset?\", since this is inherently a query-focused summarization (QFS) task, rather than an explicit retrieval task. Prior QFS methods, meanwhile, fail to scale to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems. To combine the strengths of these contrasting methods, we propose a Graph RAG approach to question answering over private text corpora that scales with both the generality of user questions and the quantity of source text to be indexed. Our approach uses an LLM to build a graph-based text index in two stages: first to derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents, then to pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities. Given a question, each community summary is used to generate a partial response, before all partial responses are again summarized in a final response to the user. For a class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range, we show that Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\\\"ive RAG baseline for both the comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers. An open-source, Python-based implementation of both global and local Graph RAG approaches is forthcoming at https://aka.ms/graphrag.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-24,\n    authors: ['Darren Edge', 'Ha Trinh', 'Newman Cheng', 'Joshua Bradley', 'Alex Chao', 'Apurva Mody', 'Steven Truitt', 'Jonathan Larson'],\n    score: 144.54719949364\n},\n{\n    title:\n######################\noutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"From Local to Global: A Graph RAG Approach to Query-Focused Summarization\", \"Medical Research\", \"Venture Capital Industry\", \"Financial Domain\", \"Startup Predictions\", \"Large Language Models\", \"Graph-Based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\", \"Time Series Analysis\", \"Multivariate Time Series Methods\", \"Evidence-Based Medical Responses\", \"Private Medical Data\", \"Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining\", \"Biomedical Domains\", \"Machine Learning Applications\", \"Genetic Algorithms\", \"Sequence Matching\", \"Classification Techniques\", \"Feature Selection\", \"Face Recognition\", \"Company Growth Analysis\", \"Decision Trees\", \"Bayesian Sequence Learning\", \"Protein Cleavage Prediction\", \"DNA Index Structures\")\n\n(\"use of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\", \"large language models (LLMs)\", \"private and/or previously unseen document collections\", \"query-focused summarization (QFS) task\", \"prior QFS methods\", \"scaling to the quantities of text indexed by typical RAG systems\", \"Graph RAG approach\", \"question answering over private text corpora\", \"generality of user questions\", \"quantity of source text to be indexed\", \"LLM to build a graph-based text index\", \"derive an entity knowledge graph from the source documents\", \"pregenerate community summaries for all groups of closely-related entities\", \"class of global sensemaking questions over datasets in the 1 million token range\", \"Graph RAG leads to substantial improvements over a na\\\"ive RAG baseline\", \"comprehensiveness and diversity of generated answers\", \"open-source, Python-based implementation\")\n\n(\"Darren Edge\", \"Ha Trinh\", \"Newman Cheng\", \"Joshua Bradley\", \"Alex Chao\", \"Apurva Mody\", \"Steven Truitt\", \"Jonathan Larson\")\n144.54719949364"}]}
