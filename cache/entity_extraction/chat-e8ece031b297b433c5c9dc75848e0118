{"result": "(\"What we Want from GALLURA\" by Nissan E. and HaCohen-Kerner Y., DOI: 10.5220/0003688304790484) discusses the use of information retrieval (IR) in generating narrative explanations, particularly focusing on the goals for the GALLURA project which employs a multiagent architecture with modules requiring IR capabilities to solve specialist subtasks. The text highlights that such tasks are best served by efficient IR and mining within large textual corpora or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative themes, motifs, and tale types.\n\nThe historical context is provided through the mention of tools like RESPONSA for retrieval from Hebrew and Aramaic historical corpora, which had significant societal impact in legal practice by enabling access to rabbinic jurisprudence. The text also references projects such as Padre Busa's Index Thomisticus and humanities computing at the Abbey of Maredsous that focused on exegesis (biblical interpretations) and homiletics.\n\nThe concept of secondary texts referring to primary texts is discussed, with examples from Jewish aggadic midrash literature like Midrash Rabbah and Yalqut Shim‘oni. The DARSHAN project, which generates ranked sets of one-sentence or one-paragraph homilies in Hebrew using intensive retrieval techniques and networks of lexical concepts, is also mentioned.\n\nThe text concludes by describing how GALLURA aims to build upon these historical practices and advancements in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humor, IR, and knowledge discovery. It emphasizes the feasibility of achieving goals similar to those of DARSHAN due to lessons learned from previous projects like RESPONSA and the multiagent architecture design phase for GALLURA.\n\nThe text also mentions that while generating output homilies, DARSHAN is capable of quoting Scripture, searching for occurrences elsewhere in the textual canon, replacing words or letters, using puns, interpreting words as acronyms, among other techniques. Filters are applied to candidate outputs based on factors such as positive vs. negative connotation and complexity assessment metrics including length, relevance of words, complexity of motif insertion, actualized motifs, transformations made, and word replacements.\n\nIn summary, the text outlines the historical context of information retrieval in religious texts, discusses the DARSHAN project's approach to generating homilies using IR techniques, and highlights how these practices inform the goals for the GALLURA project.", "input": "\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.\nNext, report all relationships among the identified entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1.

For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative themes, motifs and tale types. The state of the art in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humour, along with IR and KD, as well as the lessons of the DARSHAN project in a domain closely related to GALLURA’s, make the latter’s goals feasible in principle. 1 CONCEPTUAL & TECHNICAL BACKGROUND In the history of full-text IR, tools for retrieval from very large historical corpora in Hebrew and Aramaic were prominent, with the RESPONSA project (see e.g. Choueka, 1989a, 1989b; Choueka et al. 1971, 1987). Before the rise of Web search engines, RESPONSA tools were the ones which achieved the more far-reaching effects on society, because how they empowered the retrieval of legal precedents in rabbinic jurisprudence, thus affecting especially legal practice of family law in Israel (as for family law, in the Ottoman successor states, the usual jurisdiction is the courts of the various religious communities). Religious cultures, as being the “consumers” of religious texts, were, in a sense, the customers of a considerable portion of early projects in IR: apart from RESPONSA, whose corpora comprise the Jewish texts from the sacred sphere through the ages, this was also the case of Padre Busa’s Index Thomisticus in Milan, and of the humanities computing at the Abbey of Maredsous, in Belgium. Exegesis (such as biblical interpretations) and homiletics involve layers of texts, where a secondary text refers to and either just quotes, or discusses, some locus in the primary text; or then (as in the Jewish aggadic midrash) expands on a biblical narratives, filling the gaps where the primary text is silent. Collections of aggadic midrash from late antiquity (e.g., the Midrash Rabbah) or the Middle Ages (e.g., Yalqut Shim‘oni) are a digest of a multitude of homilies on biblical fragments of texts, developing several often alternative ideas and subnarratives. Cf. Hirshman (2006), Braude (1982), Fishbane (1993), Hartman and Budick (1986). * HyperJoseph is a hypertextual tool on the story of Joseph in Genesis, with the secondary texts elaborating on it (Nissan and Weiss, 1994). * DARSHAN is a tool that invents homilies in Hebrew (HaCohen-Kerner et al. 2007). Retrieval in DARSHAN is intensive, and so is the use of networks of lexical concepts. DARSHAN generates ranked sets of either onesentence or one-paragraph homilies. While producing its output, DARSHAN is able to quote 487 Nissan E. and HaCohen-Kerner Y.. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THE SERVICE OF GENERATING NARRATIVE EXPLANATION What we Want from GALLURA.

Use is made of patterns which consist of canned text with places where to plug in strings obtained through IR and manipulation. The user supplies as input a biblical verse, or a sentence, or a set of words, and also specifies which devices should be applied. Filters applied to the candidate output are alert, e.g., to positive vs. negative connotation. The quality of an individual output homily is assessed as a sum of weighted factors, including: length (as an indicator of complicacy); the percentage of relevant words in the homily, out of the total of words in the homily how many sentences there are; how complex it was to insert every motif into the homily generated; how many motifs were actualized in the output homily being evaluated; how many transformations were carried out; how many words were replaced in the homily.
