method under the transformer framework to get high-resolution detection results. We also develop a token-based multi-task decoder to simultaneously perform saliency and boundary detection by introducing task-related tokens and a novel patch-task-attention mechanism. Experimental results show that our model outperforms existing methods on both RGB and RGB-D SOD benchmark datasets. Most importantly, our whole framework not only provides a new perspective for the SOD field but also shows a new paradigm for transformer-based dense prediction models.

Recent Transformer language models like BERT learn powerful textual representations, but these models are targeted towards token- and sentence-level training objectives and do not leverage information on inter-document relatedness, which limits their document-level representation power. For applications on scientific documents, such as classification and recommendation, accurate embeddings of documents are a necessity. We propose SPECTER, a new method to generate document-level embedding of scientific papers based on pretraining a Transformer language model on a powerful signal of document-level relatedness: the citation graph. Unlike existing pretrained language models, Specter can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning. Additionally, to encourage further research on document-level models, we introduce SciDocs, a new evaluation benchmark consisting of seven document-level tasks ranging from citation prediction, to document classification and recommendation. We show that Specter outperforms a variety of competitive baselines on the benchmark.,\n    publicationDate: 2020-04-15\n######################\noutput:\n"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"Transformer-based Dense Prediction Models\", \"Saliency and Boundary Detection\", \"Token Fusion\", \"Token Upsampling Method\", \"Task-related Tokens\", \"Patch-task-Attention Mechanism\", \"High-resolution Detection Results\", \"RGB and RGB-D SOD Benchmark Datasets\", \"New Perspective for the SOD Field\", \"Document-level Representation Learning\", \"Citation Graph\", \"SPECTER: Document-level Representation Learning\", \"Pretrained Language Models\", \"Downstream Applications\", \"SciDocs Evaluation Benchmark\")"}]}
