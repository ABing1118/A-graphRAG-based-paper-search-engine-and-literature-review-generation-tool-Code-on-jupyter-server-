Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>)\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\nFormat each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!\n\n5. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>.\n\n-Examples-\n######################\n\nExample 1:\n\ntext:\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"fcefbb496545d2174270f27183cefa14f2830892\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/fcefbb496545d2174270f27183cefa14f2830892\",\n    \"title\": \"Retrieval-augmented Generation across Heterogeneous Knowledge\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) methods have been receiving increasing attention from the NLP community and achieved state-of-the-art performance on many NLP downstream tasks.

Instead of fine-tuning a fully parametric model, RaLM excels at its low-cost adaptation to the latest data and better source attribution mechanisms. Among various RaLM approaches, iterative RaLM delivers a better generation quality due to a more frequent interaction between the retriever and the language model. Despite the benefits, iterative RaLM usually encounters high overheads due to the frequent retrieval step. To this end, we propose RaLMSpec, a speculation-inspired framework that provides generic speed-up over iterative RaLM while preserving the same model outputs through speculative retrieval and batched verification. By further incorporating prefetching, optimal speculation stride scheduler, and asynchronous verification, RaLMSpec can automatically exploit the acceleration potential to the fullest. For naive iterative RaLM serving, extensive evaluations over three language models on four downstream QA datasets demonstrate that RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio of 1.75-2.39x, 1.04-1.39x, and 1.31-1.77x when the retriever is an exact dense retriever, approximate dense retriever, and sparse retriever respectively compared with the baseline. For KNN-LM serving, RaLMSpec can achieve a speed-up ratio up to 7.59x and 2.45x when the retriever is an exact dense retriever and approximate dense retriever, respectively, compared with the baseline.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 7,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n######################\noutput:\n", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
