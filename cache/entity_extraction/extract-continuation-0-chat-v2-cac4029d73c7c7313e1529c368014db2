A simple GPT-like architecture is then used to autoregressively model the discrete latents using spatio-temporal position encodings. Despite the simplicity in formulation and ease of training, our architecture is able to generate samples competitive with state-of-the-art GAN models for video generation on the BAIR Robot dataset, and generate high fidelity natural videos from UCF-101 and Tumbler GIF Dataset (TGIF). We hope our proposed architecture serves as a reproducible reference for a minimalistic implementation of transformer based video generation models.

Srinivas\n\n### Mobile-Former\n\n- **Title**: Mobile-Former: Bridging MobileNet and Transformer\n- **Abstract**: We present Mobile-Former, a parallel design of MobileNet and transformer with a two-way bridge in between. This structure leverages the advantages of MobileNet at local processing and transformer at global interaction. And the bridge enables bidirectional fusion of local and global features. Different from recent works on vision transformer, the transformer in Mobile-Former contains very few tokens (e.g., 6 or fewer tokens) that are randomly initialized to learn global priors, resulting in low computational cost. Combining with the proposed light-weight cross attention to model the bridge, Mobile-Former is not only computationally efficient but also has more representation power. It outperforms MobileNetV3 at low FLOP regime from 25M to\n\n### Entities and Relationships\n\n1. **Entity**: VideoGPT\n   - **Type**: Model\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Uses: VQ-VAE\n     - Models: Discrete latent representations of raw video\n     - Architecture: GPT-like\n     - Encodings: Spatio-temporal position encodings\n\n2. **Entity**: VQ-VAE\n   - **Type**: Model Component\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Used by: VideoGPT\n     - Purpose: Learning downsampled discrete latent representations of raw video\n\n3. **Entity**: GPT-like Architecture\n   - **Type**: Model Component\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Used by: VideoGPT\n     - Models: Discrete latents using spatio-temporal position encodings\n\n4. **Entity**: BAIR Robot Dataset\n   - **Type**: Dataset\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Used for: Evaluation of VideoGPT\n\n5. **Entity**: UCF-101\n   - **Type**: Dataset\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Used for: Generating high fidelity natural videos by VideoGPT\n\n6. **Entity**: TGIF (Tumbler GIF Dataset)\n   - **Type**: Dataset\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Used for: Generating high fidelity natural videos by VideoGPT\n\n7. **Entity**: Wilson Yan\n   - **Type**: Author\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Authored: GPT: a conceptually simple architecture for scaling likelihood-based generative modeling to natural videos\n\n8. **Entity**: Yunzhi Zhang\n   - **Type**: Author\n   - **Relationships**:\n     - Authored: GPT: a conceptually simple architecture for scaling likelihood-based generative modeling to natural videos\n\n9. **Entity**: P.
