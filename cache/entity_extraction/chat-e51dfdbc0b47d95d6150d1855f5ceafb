It enables lawyers to navigate the complex relationships between cases, statutes, and legal principles. The framework facilitates extracting relevant information and incorporates advanced natural language processing techniques for efficient summarization. It enables users to understand key legal concepts quickly. By fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and focusing on user-centered design, GraphRAG can significantly improve access to legal information, thereby meeting the growing needs of the legal community. This paper proposes a graph-rag-based approach for multilingual legal information retrieval (ML2IR), focusing on the Burmese language. Our graph-rag-based approach addresses the hallucination problem, crucial in legal information retrieval. Additionally, our work identifies important nodes and establishes contextual relationships, leading to higher accuracy and effective information retrieval.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-15,\n    authors: ['Shoon Lei Phyu', 'Shuhayel Jaman', 'Murataly Uchkempirov', 'Parag Kulkarni'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Enhancing Startup Success Predictions in Venture Capital: A GraphRAG Augmented Multivariate Time Series Method,\n    abstract: In the Venture Capital (VC) industry, predicting the success of startups is challenging due to limited financial data and the need for subjective revenue forecasts. Previous methods based on time series analysis often fall short as they fail to incorporate crucial inter-company relationships such as competition and collaboration. To fill the gap, this paper aims to introduce a novel approach using GraphRAG augmented time series model. With GraphRAG, time series predictive methods are enhanced by integrating these vital relationships into the analysis framework, allowing for a more dynamic understanding of the startup ecosystem in venture capital. Our experimental results demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms previous models in startup success predictions.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-18,\n    authors: ['Zitian Gao', 'Yihao Xiao'],\n    score\n######################\noutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
