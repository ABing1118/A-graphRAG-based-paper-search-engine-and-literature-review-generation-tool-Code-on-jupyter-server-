Everything should be in The two documents you've provided cover distinct areas of research in computer science and information retrieval, each with its own set of methodologies and applications.\n\n**Document 1**: This document focuses on the development of a technique called HybridRAG (Hybrid Retrieval and Generation) for improving question answering systems. The technique combines elements from vector databases and knowledge graphs to enhance both the retrieval accuracy and answer generation quality in question-answering tasks, particularly within financial domains. It demonstrates that by integrating context from both vector databases and knowledge graphs, it outperforms traditional methods like VectorRAG (which relies solely on vector databases) and GraphRAG (which uses knowledge graphs alone).
