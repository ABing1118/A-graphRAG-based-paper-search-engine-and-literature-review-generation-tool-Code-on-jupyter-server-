Investigating LLMs' Behavior Style to Conflicting Prompts,\n    abstract: This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory. This will not only help to understand LLMs' decision mechanism but also benefit real-world applications, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Drawing on cognitive theory, we target the first scenario of decision-making styles where there is no superiority in the conflict and categorize LLMs' preference into dependent, intuitive, and rational/irrational styles. Another scenario of factual robustness considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks, which can also distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally in the first scenario. To quantify them, we establish a complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, a robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics. Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors. And, with role play intervention, we can change the styles, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound. One of our key takeaways is to optimize models or the prompts according to the identified style. For instance, RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results -- being dependent to better leverage informative context; and, being intuitive when external prompt is noisy.\n\nOutput:\n\n(ORGANIZATION: Large Language Models (LLMs) <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: BEHAVIORAL STUDY <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: This study investigates the behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs) when faced with conflicting prompts versus their internal memory.)\n\n(ORGANIZATION: Large Pre-Trained Language Models <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: KNOWLEDGE STORAGE AND APPLICATION <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: These models are shown to store factual knowledge in their parameters and achieve state-of-the-art results when fine-tuned on downstream NLP tasks.)\n\n(ORGANIZATION: Large Pre-Trained Language Models <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: FACTUAL ROBUSTNESS EVALUATION <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: The study considers the correctness of prompt and memory in knowledge-intensive tasks to distinguish if LLMs behave rationally or irrationally.)\n\n(ORGANIZATION: Large Language Models (LLMs) <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: BENCHMARKING FRAMEWORK DEVELOPMENT <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: A complete benchmarking framework including a dataset, robustness evaluation pipeline, and corresponding metrics is established to quantify the behaviors of LLMs.)\n\n(ORGANIZATION: Large Language Models (LLMs) <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: Extensive experiments with seven LLMs reveal their varying behaviors.)\n\n(ORGANIZATION: Large Language Models (LLMs) <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: ROLE PLAY INTERVENTION EFFECTIVENESS <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: Role play intervention can change the decision-making styles of LLMs, but different models present distinct adaptivity and upper-bound.)\n\n(ORGANIZATION: RAG Models <|> GEO: No specific geographical entity mentioned <|> CLAIM TYPE: ADAPTABILITY IN RESPONSE TO RETRIEVAL QUALITY <|> CLAIM STATUS: TRUE <|> CLAIM DATE: 2023-09-29 <|> CLAIM DETAILS: RAG models with high role play adaptability may dynamically adjust the interventions according to the quality of retrieval results.)\n\nPlease note that in this response, I have assumed that \"ORGANIZATION\" refers to Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Pre-Trained Language Models as they are not explicitly mentioned elsewhere.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.
