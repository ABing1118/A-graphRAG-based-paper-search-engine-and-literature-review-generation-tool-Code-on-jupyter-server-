Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

In the experimental section, this paper conducts experiments using multiple cross-language tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and text summarization, to evaluate the performancen and domain of the model in different languages. The experimental results indicate that introducing external knowledge sources significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the model, especially in resource-scarce language pairs. This research not only provides an effective solution for zero-shot cross-language transfer, but also provides new insights into understanding the role of external knowledge in improving the performance of NLP models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-24,\n    authors: ['Wenmin Wang', 'Peilin Zhang', 'Ge Liu', 'Ruihua Wu', 'Guixiang Song'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: A Novel Approach of Augmenting Training Data for Legal Text Segmentation by Leveraging Domain Knowledge,\n    abstract: None,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['R.

The real world in which they operate, however, is full of complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty. In this yearâ€™s Turing Lecture, Professor Chris Bishop discusses the field of machine learning, and shows how uncertainty can be modelled and quantified using probabilities. Professor Bishop will look at the recent developments in probabilistic modelling that have greatly expanded the variety and scale of machine learning applications, and he explores the future potential for this technology. 4.2 Integrative Analysis of Pathology, Radiology and High Throughput Molecular Data Joel Saltz, Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University The talk is available at: http://www.nesc.ac.uk/action\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-05-24T00:00:00<|>2024-05-24T00:00:00<|>The paper conducts experiments using multiple cross-language tasks to evaluate the performance and domain of the model in different languages.
