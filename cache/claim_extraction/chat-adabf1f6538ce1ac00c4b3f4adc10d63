Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

However, creating KGs for GraphRAGs remains a significant challenge due to accuracy and scalability limitations of traditional methods. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA 2 (13B), and BERT to generate KGs directly from unstructured data, bypassing traditional pipelines. Using metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Graph Edit Distance, and Semantic Similarity, we evaluate the models' ability to generate high-quality KGs. Results demonstrate that GPT-4 achieves superior semantic fidelity and structural accuracy, LLaMA 2 excels in lightweight, domain-specific graphs, and BERT provides insights into challenges in entity-relationship modeling. This study underscores the potential of LLMs to streamline KG creation and enhance GraphRAG accessibility for real-world applications, while setting a foundation for future advancements.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-10,\n    authors: ['Ahan Bhatt', 'Nandan Vaghela', 'Kush Dudhia'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Development of an Intelligent Coal Production and Operation Platform Based on a Real-Time Data Warehouse and AI Model,\n    abstract: Smart mining solutions currently suffer from inadequate big data support and insufficient AI applications. The main reason for these limitations is the absence of a comprehensive industrial internet cloud platform tailored for the coal industry, which restricts resource integration. This paper presents the development of an innovative platform designed to enhance safety, operational efficiency, and automation in fully mechanized coal mining in China. This platform integrates cloud edge computing, real-time data processing, and AI-driven analytics to improve decision-making and maintenance strategies. Several AI models have been developed for the proactive maintenance of comprehensive mining face equipment, including early warnings for periodic weighting and the detection of common faults such as those in\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
