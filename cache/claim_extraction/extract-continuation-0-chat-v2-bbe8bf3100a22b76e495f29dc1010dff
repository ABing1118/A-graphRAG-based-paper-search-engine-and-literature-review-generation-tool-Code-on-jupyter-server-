The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative themes, motifs and tale types. The state of the art in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humour, along with IR and KD, as well as the lessons of the DARSHAN project in a domain closely related to GALLURA’s, make the latter’s goals feasible in principle. 1 CONCEPTUAL & TECHNICAL BACKGROUND In the history of full-text IR, tools for retrieval from very large historical corpora in Hebrew and Aramaic were prominent, with the RESPONSA project (see e.g. Choueka, 1989a, 1989b; Choueka et al. 1971, 1987). Before the rise of Web search engines, RESPONSA tools were the ones which achieved the more far-reaching effects on society, because how they empowered the retrieval of legal precedents in rabbinic jurisprudence, thus affecting especially legal practice of family law in Israel (as for family law, in the Ottoman successor states, the usual jurisdiction is the courts of the various religious communities). Religious cultures, as being the “consumers” of religious texts, were, in a sense, the customers of a considerable portion of early projects in IR: apart from RESPONSA, whose corpora comprise the Jewish texts from the sacred sphere through the ages, this was also the case of Padre Busa’s Index Thomisticus in Milan, and of the humanities computing at the Abbey of Maredsous, in Belgium\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
