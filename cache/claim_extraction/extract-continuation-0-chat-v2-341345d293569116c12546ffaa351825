Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made.

However, most existing training methods rely on extracting supervision signals from LLMs' weights or their output probabilities, which is not only resource-intensive but also incompatible with black-box LLMs. In this paper, we introduce \\textit{Intermediate Distillation}, a data-efficient knowledge distillation training scheme that treats LLMs as black boxes and distills their knowledge via an innovative LLM-ranker-retriever pipeline, solely using LLMs' ranking generation as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of retriever models with only 1,000 training instances. Moreover, our distilled retriever model significantly boosts performance in question-answering tasks within the RAG framework, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to economically and effectively train smaller models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-18,\n    authors: ['Zizhong Li', 'Haopeng Zhang', 'Jiawei Zhang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking to Improve Factualness in Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, yet they often struggle with maintaining factual accuracy, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains like healthcare.
