Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Despite their advanced language capabilities, when it comes to domain-specific and knowledge-intensive tasks, LLMs suffer from hallucinations, knowledge cut-offs, and lack of knowledge attributions. Additionally, fine tuning LLMs' intrinsic knowledge to highly specific domains is an expensive and time consuming process. The retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) process has recently emerged as a method capable of optimization of LLM responses, by referencing them to a predetermined ontology. It was shown that using a Knowledge Graph (KG) ontology for RAG improves the QA accuracy, by taking into account relevant sub-graphs that preserve the information in a structured manner. In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(COMPANY A<|>GOVERNMENT AGENCY B<|>ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>Company A was found to engage in anti-competitive practices because it was fined for bid rigging in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B according to an article published on 2022/01/10<|>According to an article published on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.)\n##(ROZHIN YASAEI<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>SUSPECTED<|>2015-01-01T00:00:00<|>2015-12-30T00:00:00<|>Rozhin Yasaei was suspected of engaging in unknown activities in 2015<|>The text mentions Rozhin Yasaei being suspected but does not specify the type of claim or fact)\n##(GREGORY RENARD<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>SUSPECTED<|>2015-01-01T00:00:00<|>2015-12-30T00:00:00<|>Gregory Renard was suspected of engaging in unknown activities in 2015<|>The text mentions Gregory Renard being suspected but does not specify the type of claim or fact)\n##(GOVERNMENT AGENCY B<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>Government Agency B was involved in the issuance of fines to Company A for bid rigging activities<|>The text mentions Government Agency B issuing fines but does not specify the type of claim or fact)\n##(SMART-SLIC<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-01-01T00:00:00<|>SMART-SLIC framework was introduced for domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation using vector stores, knowledge graphs, and tensor factorization<|>The text mentions SMART-SLIC being an introduction to a new framework but does not specify the type of claim or fact)\n##(CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROMPTING AGENTS<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-01-01T00:00:00<|>Chain-of-thought prompting agents were paired with SMART-SLIC framework for domain-specific question answering tasks<|>The text mentions chain-of-thought prompting agents being used in conjunction with the SMART-SLIC framework but does not specify the type of claim or fact)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
