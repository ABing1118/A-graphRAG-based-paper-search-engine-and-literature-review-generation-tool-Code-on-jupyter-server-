Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

RAG combines retrieval mechanisms with generative language models to enhance the accuracy of outputs, addressing key limitations of LLMs. The study explores the basic architecture of RAG, focusing on how retrieval and generation are integrated to handle knowledge-intensive tasks. A detailed review of the significant technological advancements in RAG is provided, including key innovations in retrieval-augmented language models and applications across various domains such as question-answering, summarization, and knowledge-based tasks. Recent research breakthroughs are discussed, highlighting novel methods for improving retrieval efficiency. Furthermore, the paper examines ongoing challenges such as scalability, bias, and ethical concerns in deployment. Future research directions are proposed, focusing on improving the robustness of RAG models, expanding the scope of application of RAG models, and addressing societal implications. This survey aims to serve as a foundational resource for researchers and practitioners in understanding the potential of RAG and its trajectory in natural language processing.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 2,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Review\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-10-03\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2311997786\",\n        \"name\": \"Shailja Gupta\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2311893279\",\n        \"name\": \"Rajesh Ranjan\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2321535962\",\n        \"name\": \"Surya Narayan Singh\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 86.47918433002164\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"c00980a88effd94814bb7650ccaf6ab6c184d249\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c00980a88effd94814bb7650ccaf6ab6c184d249\",\n    \"title\": \"Adapting to Non-Stationary Environments: Multi-Armed Bandit Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation on Knowledge Graphs\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Despite the superior performance of Large language models on many NLP tasks, they still face significant limitations in memorizing extensive world knowledge. Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs that encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in real-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of non-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user satisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit enhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse capabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within this framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The system utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by selecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the historical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while achieving state-of-the-art performance in stationary environments.

However, this mechanism still produces hallucinations and structural incoherence in knowledge-intensive tasks. Additionally, many existing techniques neither holistically leverage multiple properties of text nor integrate diverse prompting and agenting frameworks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel methodology that extracts and utilizes unstructured and structured properties of text to construct layered RAG pipelines designed to enhance complex LLM reasoning. Our approach synthesizes three distinct RAG methodologies, each specialized in various aspects: textual entity knowledge graph extraction (Textual Entity RAG); community summary and entity generation (Microsoft GraphRAG), and structural link navigation (\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
