Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The generation quality relies heavily on the retrieved passages, which serve as contextual information. State-of-the-art Retrieval Augmented Generation models with marginalized output dominate this area but focus too much on label-relevant passages, rather than question-relevant passages and answers. This work addresses this issue by incorporating rich answer encoding through Dense Knowledge Similarity (DKS) and Retriever as Answer Classifier (RAC). We demonstrate the advantages of our proposed approach in open domain question answering (MSMARCO) and conversation (Wizard of Wikipedia) datasets, reporting both generation and retrieval metrics. In the MSMARCO development set, our best model achieves 12.1% relative improvement 1 on Recall@1 and 4.5% relative improvement on BLEU-4 compared to the baseline model. In the KILT-WoW leaderboard, our best model achieves 8.9% relative improvement on R-Precision and 13.3% relative improvement on KILT-RL compared to the baseline model.

Researchers explore the implementation of retrieval-augmented generation methods, aiming to enhance the authenticity and specificity in knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper discusses the practical application in industrial settings, particularly in assisting design personnel with navigating complex standards and quality manuals. Utilizing an open-source model with 6 billion parameters, the study employs quantization technology for local deployment, addressing computational challenges. The retrieval-augmented generation framework is analyzed, emphasizing the integration of document parsing, vector databases, and text embedding models. Experimental results compare models at different quantization levels, revealing trade-offs between response time, model size, and performance metrics. The findings suggest that 4-bit integer quantization is optimal for standard document retrieval and question-answering tasks, highlighting practical considerations for CPU inference. The paper concludes with insights into hyper-parameter tuning, model comparisons, and future optimizations for enhanced performance in edge device deployments of large language models.\",\n    \"venue\": \"IoTAAI\",\n    \"year\": 2023,\n    \"citationCount\": 1,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Created by combining the information from all three papers)\n\n- Paper Title: Retrieval Augmented Generation with Rich Answer Encoding\n\n- Abstract: Knowledge-intensive generation tasks like generative question answering require models to retrieve appropriate passages from external knowledge sources to support answer generation.
