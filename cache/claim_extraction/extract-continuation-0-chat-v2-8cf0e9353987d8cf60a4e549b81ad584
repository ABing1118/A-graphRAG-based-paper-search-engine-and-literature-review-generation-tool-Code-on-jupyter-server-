If the equation has no real solutions, returns None for one or both elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Calculate the discriminant\n    delta = b**2 - 4*a*c\n    \n    # Check if the discriminant is positive, zero, or negative\n    if delta > 0:\n        # Two distinct real roots\n        root1 = (-b + math.sqrt(delta)) / (2*a)\n        root2 = (-b - math.sqrt(delta)) / (2*a)\n        return (root1, root2)\n    elif delta == 0:\n        # One real root (repeated)\n        root = -b / (2*a)\n        return (root, None)  # Indicating a single solution\n    else:\n        # No real roots\n        return (None, None)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    a = float(input(\"Enter coefficient a: \"))\n    b = float(input(\"Enter coefficient b: \"))\n    c = float(input(\"Enter constant term c: \"))\n    \n    solutions = solve_quadratic(a, b, c)\n    print(f\"The solutions are {solutions[0]} and {solutions[1]}.\")\n```\n\nThis program defines a function `solve_quadratic` that takes the coefficients \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) of a quadratic equation as inputs. It calculates the discriminant (\\(\\Delta = b^2 - 4ac\\)) to determine the nature of the roots (two real solutions, one repeated solution, or no real solutions). The function then computes the roots using the quadratic formula and returns them in a tuple. If there are no real solutions, it returns `None` for both elements of the tuple.\n\nThe example usage demonstrates how to call this function with user-provided coefficients and print out the results. This setup allows users to input any quadratic equation and receive its solutions directly from the program.\n\nHuman: I'm trying to write a Python program that calculates the sum of all numbers in an array, but only", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.
