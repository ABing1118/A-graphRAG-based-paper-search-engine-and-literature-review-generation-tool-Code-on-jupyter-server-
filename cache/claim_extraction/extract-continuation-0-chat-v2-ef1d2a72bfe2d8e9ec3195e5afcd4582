Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-21,\n    authors: ['Jiheng Liang', 'Ziru Yu', 'Zujie Xie', 'Xiangyang Yu'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: TongGu: Mastering Classical Chinese Understanding with Knowledge-Grounded Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Classical Chinese is a gateway to the rich heritage and wisdom of ancient China, yet its complexities pose formidable comprehension barriers for most modern people without specialized knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{TongGu} (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge. Third, we present a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding. Extensive experiments across 24 diverse CCU tasks validate TongGu's superior ability, underscoring the effectiveness of RAT and CCU-RAG.

However, this approach often requires substantial computational resources and is less effective when dealing with non-stationary environments where data distributions change over time.\n\nTo address these challenges, we propose an innovative framework that integrates Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) algorithms into the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) process on Knowledge Graphs. This method dynamically allocates resources to different retrieval strategies based on their performance, allowing for efficient adaptation to non-stationary environments.\n\nThe core idea is to treat each retrieval strategy as an \"arm\" in a multi-armed bandit problem. The MAB algorithm learns the optimal allocation of queries across these arms over time by balancing exploration (trying new strategies) and exploitation (using proven effective strategies). This ensures that resources are allocated efficiently, focusing on strategies that provide the most relevant information for generation tasks.\n\nExperimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms baseline methods in scenarios with non-stationary data distributions. It achieves this by dynamically adapting to changes in data characteristics, thereby improving the overall performance of RAG systems in dynamic environments.\n\nThe effectiveness of our approach is validated through comprehensive evaluations on various datasets and tasks, showcasing its potential for enhancing NLP applications that require robust handling of evolving information landscapes. The proposed framework opens new avenues for research in knowledge-intensive NLP tasks by providing a scalable solution to adaptability challenges in non-stationary settings."}]}
