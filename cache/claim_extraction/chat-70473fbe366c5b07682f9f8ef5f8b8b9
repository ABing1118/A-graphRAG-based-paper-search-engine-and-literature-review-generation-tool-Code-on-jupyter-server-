Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, the standard RAG approach fails to fully leverage the information within the retrieved documents, which can lead to incorrect response generation. While advanced RAG approaches empower LLMs to understand the correlation between queries and documents, they require costly annotation. In this work, we propose a strategy to help LLMs better leverage the information within retrieved documents in RAG system while reducing data acquisition costs. We fine-tuned an LLM on a dataset comprising queries, retrieved documents, and their relevance scores generated by a pre-trained biomedical re-ranker to adapt the model for answering questions from reference documents. The fine-tuned model can independently score retrieved documents before answering the question, thereby more effectively utilizing the information contained within retrieved documents. Experimental results shows that we have improved the model’s accuracy on two biomedical benchmarks while reduced the costs of data acquisition.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-03,\n    authors: ['Yinkui Huang', 'Tianrun Gao', 'Jiangjiang Zhang', 'Xiaohong Liu', 'Guangyu Wang'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: ChatTf: A Knowledge Graph-Enhanced Intelligent Q&A System for Mitigating Factuality Hallucinations in Traditional Folklore,\n    abstract: Large language models are rapidly advancing the field of artificial intelligence, with current research focusing primarily on traditional natural language understanding tasks, such as question answering and information extraction. However, in knowledge-intensive domains, such as intangible cultural heritage, hallucination problems due to insufficient domain knowledge persist. To address this, we present ChatTf, a knowledge graph-enhanced intelligent Q&A system, exemplified by Chinese traditional folklore, aimed at reducing factuality hallucinations in this domain. Specifically, we constructed the Traditional Folklore Ontology (TFOnto) and proposed the Zero-shot Traditional Folklore Triplet Extraction (ZFTE) framework. Driven by TFOnto, ZFTE builds a Traditional Folklore Knowledge Graph (TFKG). We then proposed a dual-stage Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework (TFKG-RAG) based on TFKG to provide traditional folklore knowledge to large language models, mitigating factuality hallucinations in folklore Q&A tasks. In the experimental phase, ChatTf achieved an accuracy of 96.7% on a self-built TFCQD test set, outperforming several state-of-the-art baseline methods. This demonstrates the accuracy and reliability of folklore domain question answering.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Jun Xu', 'Hao Zhang', 'Haijing Zhang', 'Jiawei Lu', 'Gang Xiao'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: Investigating on the External Knowledge in RAG for Zero-Shot Cross-Language Transfer,\n    abstract: In the field of multilingual natural language processing (NLP), zero-shot cross-language transfer is an important research direction, which aims to enable models to effectively learn and reason without target language training data. This study explores the role of external knowledge in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to improve the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. This paper proposes a new model architecture that enriches the knowledge base of the RAG model by integrating external knowledge bases, thereby enhancing its information bridging capabilities between source and target languages. In the experimental section, this paper conducts experiments using multiple cross-language tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and text summarization, to evaluate the performancen and domain of the model in different languages. The experimental results indicate that introducing external knowledge sources significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the model, especially in resource-scarce language pairs. This research not only provides an effective solution for zero-shot cross-language transfer, but also provides new\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
