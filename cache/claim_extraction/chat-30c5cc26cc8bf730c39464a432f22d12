The authors propose Audiobox TTA-RAG, a novel method that enhances the TTA process with additional conditioning contexts based on Audiobox, a conditional flow-matching audio generation model. Unlike traditional solutions which generate audio conditioned solely on text input, this approach augments the conditioning input with retrieved audio samples to provide additional acoustic information for generating target audio.\n\n2. **Hybrid Retrieval Approach**: This paper focuses on enhancing retrieval-augmented generation systems by integrating embeddings from both textual and knowledge graph information. The hybrid method aims to address limitations of traditional retrievers that may only capture semantic meaning, potentially overlooking global relationships between passages. By combining textual embeddings with knowledge graph information, the authors propose a solution designed for generic application in various domains, including health-tech industry use cases.\n\n3. **Audiobox TTA-RAG**: This paper discusses an improvement to Audiobox TTA-RAG, which is based on the conditional flow-matching audio generation model. The focus here is on evaluating and demonstrating how the proposed method can effectively leverage retrieved audio samples to significantly improve zero-shot and few-shot Text-To-Audio performance across multiple evaluation metrics while maintaining semantically aligned audio generation for in-domain settings.\n\n- The papers collectively contribute to advancements in text-to-audio synthesis, retrieval-based augmentation techniques, and hybrid information integration methods within natural language processing.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

It is often challenging to generate high-quality audio for audio events that are unseen or uncommon in the training set. Inspired by the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Large Language Model (LLM)-based knowledge-intensive tasks, we extend the TTA process with additional conditioning contexts. We propose Audiobox TTA-RAG, a novel retrieval-augmented TTA approach based on Audiobox, a conditional flow-matching audio generation model. Unlike the vanilla Audiobox TTA solution which generates audio conditioned on text, we augmented the conditioning input with retrieved audio samples that provide additional acoustic information to generate the target audio. Our retrieval method does not require the external database to have labeled audio, offering more practical use cases. To evaluate our proposed method, we curated test sets in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our empirical results show that the proposed model can effectively leverage the retrieved audio samples and significantly improve zero-shot and few-shot TTA performance, with large margins on multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the ability to generate semantically aligned audio for the in-domain setting. In addition, we investigate the effect of different retrieval methods and data sources.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Engineering\",\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-11-07\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2330162392\",\n        \"name\": \"Mu Yang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2261676061\",\n        \"name\": \"Bowen Shi\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2261636821\",\n        \"name\": \"Matt Le\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2265493884\",\n        \"name\": \"Wei-Ning Hsu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2894428\",\n        \"name\": \"Andros Tjandra\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"422834b1229b9451ba9930b245a22eae1a825b5a\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/422834b1229b9451ba9930b245a22eae1a825b5a\",\n    \"title\": \"A Hybrid Retrieval Approach for Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-intensive question-answering tasks. The performance of RAG is greatly influenced by the retriever component, which typically relies on semantic similarity between the text embeddings of the query and the passages to identify the relevant context. However, text embedding models may only capture the semantic meaning of individual passages, potentially neglecting global relationships between them. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid retrieval method that integrates embeddings encoded from textual and knowledge graph information. Although in this paper, the knowledge graphs describe the passage relationships in a health-tech industry use case, the hybrid embedding solution is designed to be generic. Furthermore, the proposed retrieval approach aims to offer straight-forward implementation without requiring complex joint learning processes. Our results on custom test sets demonstrate significantly enhanced accuracy and ranking of the retriever, thus, supporting the LLM-based reader component in generating more accurate responses.\",\n    \"venue\": \"International Conference on Natural Language and Speech Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"open\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
