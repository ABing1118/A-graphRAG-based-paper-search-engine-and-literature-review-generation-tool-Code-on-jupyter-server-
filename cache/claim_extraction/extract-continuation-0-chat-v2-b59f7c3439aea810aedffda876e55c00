Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, a significant gap remains in evaluating domain-specific information retrieval â€“ the basis for answer generation. To address this challenge, this work simulates the typical tasks of a sustainability analyst by examining 30 sustainability reports with 16 detailed climate-related questions. As a result, we obtain a dataset with over 8.5K unique question-source-answer pairs labeled by different levels of relevance. Furthermore, we develop a use case with the dataset to investigate the integration of expert knowledge into information retrieval with embeddings. Although we show that incorporating expert knowledge works, we also outline the critical limitations of embeddings in knowledge-intensive downstream domains like climate change communication.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-14,\n    authors: ['Tobias Schimanski', 'Jingwei Ni', 'Roberto Spacey', 'Nicola Ranger', 'Markus Leippold'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Intermediate Distillation: Data-Efficient Distillation from Black-Box LLMs for Information Retrieval,\n    abstract: Recent research has explored distilling knowledge from large language models (LLMs) to optimize retriever models, especially within the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework. However, most existing training methods rely on extracting supervision signals from LLMs' weights or their output probabilities, which is not only resource-intensive but also incompatible with black-box LLMs. In this paper, we introduce \\textit{Intermediate Distillation}, a data-efficient knowledge distillation training scheme that treats LLMs as black boxes and distills their knowledge via an innovative LLM-ranker-retriever pipeline, solely using LLMs' ranking generation as the supervision signal. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method can significantly improve the performance of retriever models with only 1,000 training instances. Moreover, our distilled retriever model significantly boosts performance in question-answering tasks within the RAG framework, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to economically and effectively train smaller models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-18,\n    authors: ['Zizhong Li', 'Haopeng Zhang', 'Jiawei Zhang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking to Improve Factualness in Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various natural language processing tasks, yet they often struggle with maintaining factual accuracy, particularly in knowledge-intensive domains like healthcare. This study introduces LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking, a novel approach designed to enhance the factual reliability of LLMs, with a focus on medical question answering (QA). LEAF utilizes a dual strategy to enhance the factual accuracy of responses from models such as Llama 3 70B Instruct and Llama 3 8B Instruct. The first strategy, Fact-Check-Then-RAG, improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating fact-checking results to guide the retrieval process without updating model parameters. The second strategy, Learning from Fact-Checks via Self-Training, involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fact-checked responses or applying Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) with fact-checking as a ranking mechanism, both updating LLM parameters from supervision. These findings suggest that integrating fact-checked responses whether through RAG enhancement or self-training enhances the reliability and factual correctness of LLM outputs, offering a promising solution for applications where information accuracy is crucial.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-31,\n    authors: ['Hieu Tran', 'Junda Wang', 'Yujan Ting', 'Weijing Huang', 'Terrence Chen'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Can Open-Source LLMs Compete with Commercial Models?
