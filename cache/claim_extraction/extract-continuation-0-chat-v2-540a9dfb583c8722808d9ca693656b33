The text seems to be discussing advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) specifically related to Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), proposing a new model called TongGu and describing its contributions.\n\nSince there are no clear claims mentioned in the text that could be categorized under 'organization', 'person', 'geo', or 'event', I will assume you might need entities based on context. Here's an example of how we might infer some entities:\n\n1. **Organization**: \"SCUT-DLVCLab\" - This is a lab name which could potentially be associated with the development and research behind TongGu model.\n\n2. **Person**: Authors' names mentioned in the text: [\"Jiahuan Cao\", \"Dezhi Peng\", \"Peirong Zhang\", \"Yongxin Shi\", \"Yang Liu\", \"Kai Ding\", \"Lianwen Jin\"] - These are researchers who contributed to the development of TongGu.\n\n3. **Geo**: The geographical location where SCUT-DLVCLab is based could be inferred as being in China, given that it's a Chinese lab name.\n\n4. **Event**: The publication date mentioned: \"2024-07-04\" - This event refers to the time when this research was published.\n\nGiven these entities and assuming claims related to them:\n\n**Claim 1 (Organization)**:\nSubject_entity: SCUT-DLVCLab\nObject_entity: NONE\nClaim_type: RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT\nClaim_status: TRUE\nClaim_start_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_end_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_details: SCUT-DLVCLab published a new model called TongGu for Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU) on July 4, 2024.\n\n**Claim 2 (Person)**:\nSubject_entity: Jiahuan Cao\nObject_entity: NONE\nClaim_type: CONTRIBUTION TO RESEARCH\nClaim_status: TRUE\nClaim_start_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_end_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_details: Jiahuan Cao contributed to the development of TongGu model for Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU) as part of SCUT-DLVCLab.\n\n**Claim 3 (Geo)**:\nSubject_entity: China\nObject_entity: NONE\nClaim_type: LOCATION OF RESEARCH INSTITUTION\nClaim_status: TRUE\nClaim_start_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_end_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_details: SCUT-DLVCLab, the research institution behind TongGu model for Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), is based in China.\n\n**Claim 4 (Event)**:\nSubject_entity: Publication of Research\nObject_entity: NONE\nClaim_type: RESEARCH PUBLICATION\nClaim_status: TRUE\nClaim_start_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_end_date: 2024-07-04T00:00:00\nClaim_details: The research paper on TongGu model for Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU) was published on July 4, 2024.\n\nPlease note that these claims are speculative based on the context provided and might not reflect actual events or statuses.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{TongGu} (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge. Third, we present a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding. Extensive experiments across 24 diverse CCU tasks validate TongGu's superior ability, underscoring the effectiveness of RAT and CCU-RAG.
