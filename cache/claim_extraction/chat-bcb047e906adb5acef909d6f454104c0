Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search for long-form retrieval-augmented generation. Empirical results demonstrate that FOD outperforms traditional strategies such as abstention, reranking, or contrastive decoding significantly in terms of faithfulness, achieving over 10% improvement across six datasets.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-06-19\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2107535909\",\n        \"name\": \"Di Wu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2308241925\",\n        \"name\": \"Jia-Chen Gu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2281946748\",\n        \"name\": \"Fan Yin\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2256996328\",\n        \"name\": \"Nanyun Peng\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2257127887\",\n        \"name\": \"Kai-Wei Chang\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"52008bf2a58054e38a7b630dcf021e1c9bf8d109\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52008bf2a58054e38a7b630dcf021e1c9bf8d109\",\n    \"title\": \"Adapting Large Language Models for Biomedicine though Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Documents Scoring\",\n    \"abstract\": \"By integrating the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external biomedical knowledge repositories, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers significant potential for addressing knowledge-intensive biomedical tasks, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of clinical decision-making. However, the standard RAG approach fails to fully leverage the information within the retrieved documents, which can lead to incorrect response generation. While advanced RAG approaches empower LLMs to understand the correlation between queries and documents, they require costly annotation. In this work, we propose a strategy to help LLMs better leverage the information within retrieved documents in RAG system while reducing data acquisition costs. We fine-tuned an LLM on a dataset comprising queries, retrieved documents, and their relevance scores generated by a pre-trained biomedical re-ranker to adapt the model for answering questions from reference documents. The fine-tuned model can independently score retrieved documents before answering the question, thereby more effectively utilizing the information contained within retrieved documents. Experimental results shows that we have improved the model’s accuracy on two biomedical benchmarks while reduced the costs of data acquisition.\",\n    \"venue\": \"IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-12-03\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2339515370\",\n        \"name\": \"Yinkui Huang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2240059911\",\n        \"name\": \"Tianrun Gao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2339549165\",\n        \"name\": \"Jiangjiang Zhang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2110997991\",\n        \"name\": \"Xiaohong Liu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2197687830\",\n        \"name\": \"Guangyu Wang\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 76\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"e447849a529b61dfb5a8a88b2a1551dbfa3ef3e9\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e447849a529b61dfb5a8a88b2a1551dbfa3ef3e9\",\n    \"title\": \"E2E-AFG: An End-to-End Model with Adaptive Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of large language models.
