Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

ToG-2 alternates between graph retrieval and context retrieval to search for in-depth clues relevant to the question, enabling LLMs to generate answers. We conduct a series of well-designed experiments to highlight the following advantages of ToG-2: 1) ToG-2 tightly couples the processes of context retrieval and graph retrieval, deepening context retrieval via the KG while enabling reliable graph retrieval based on contexts; 2) it achieves deep and faithful reasoning in LLMs through an iterative knowledge retrieval process of collaboration between contexts and the KG; and 3) ToG-2 is training-free and plug-and-play compatible with various LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ToG-2 achieves overall state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on 6 out of 7 knowledge-intensive datasets with GPT-3.5, and can elevate the performance of smaller models (e.g., LLAMA-2-13B) to the level of GPT-3.5's direct reasoning.

Previous research on multi-view retrieval often focused solely on different semantic forms of queries, neglecting the expression of specific domain knowledge perspectives. This paper introduces a novel multi-view RAG framework, MVRAG, tailored for knowledge-dense domains that utilizes intention-aware query rewriting from multiple domain viewpoints to enhance retrieval precision, thereby improving the effectiveness of the final inference. Experiments conducted on legal and medical case retrieval demonstrate significant improvements in recall and precision rates with our framework. Our multi-perspective retrieval approach unleashes the potential of multi-view information enhancing RAG tasks, accelerating the further application of LLMs in knowledge-intensive fields.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-19,\n    authors: ['Guanhua Chen', 'Wenhan Yu', 'Lei Sha'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: ActiveRAG: Autonomously Knowledge Assimilation and Accommodation through Retrieval-Augmented Agents,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage external knowledge, enhancing their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, existing RAG models often treat LLMs as passive recipients of information, which can lead to interference from noisy retrieved content. In this paper, we introduce ActiveRAG, a multi-agent framework that mimics human learning behavior to help LLMs actively engage with and learn from retrieved evidence. ActiveRAG designs a knowledge assimilation agent to form the knowledge understanding by associating external knowledge with the parametric memory of LLMs. Then our model employs the thought accommodation agent to calibrate the internal thought of LLMs for response refinement. Our experiments show that ActiveRAG achieves a 10\\% improvement over vanilla RAG on various question-answering benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that ActiveRAG mitigates the impact of noisy retrievals, alleviates conflicts between external knowledge and parametric memory and improves the self-consistency of LLMs in answering the question.
