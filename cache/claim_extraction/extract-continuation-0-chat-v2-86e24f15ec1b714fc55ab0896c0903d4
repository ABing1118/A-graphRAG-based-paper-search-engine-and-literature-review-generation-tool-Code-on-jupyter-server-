Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, it was observed by previous works that retrieval is not always helpful, especially when the LLM is already knowledgeable on the query to answer. Motivated by this, Adaptive Retrieval-Augmented Generation (ARAG) studies retrieving only when the knowledge asked by the query is absent in the LLM. Previous works of ARAG either require accessing the pre-training corpus or prompting with additional model inferences. Aiming to avoid such drawbacks, we propose to determine whether the model is knowledgeable on a query via inspecting the (contextualized) pre-trained token embeddings of LLMs. We hypothesize that such embeddings capture rich information on the model's intrinsic knowledge base, which enables an efficient way of judging the necessity to retrieve from an external corpus. Extensive experiments demonstrate our ARAG approach's superior performance across various benchmarks.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-04,\n    authors: ['Chengkai Huang', 'Yu Xia', 'Rui Wang', 'Kaige Xie', 'Tong Yu', 'Julian McAuley', 'Lina Yao'],\n    score: 90.79441541679836\n},\n{\n    title:\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
