Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

However, their ability to access and precisely manip- ulate knowledge is still limited, and hence on knowledge- intensive tasks, their performance lags behind task-specific architectures. Additionally, providing provenance for their decisions and updating their world knowledge remain open research problems. Pre- trained models with a differentiable access mechanism to explicit non-parametric memory have so far been only investigated for extractive downstream tasks. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a prevalent ap- proach to infuse a private knowledge base of documents with Large Language Models (LLM) to build Generative Q&A(Question-Answering) systems. However, RAG accu- racy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of docu- ments scales up,with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose different ways to optimize the re- treivals, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, Reranking and dynamic chunking schemes.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-08-31,\n    authors: ['Ashish Bansal'],\n    score: 80\n},\n{\n    title: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT: A PILOT STUDY,\n    abstract: The natural language processing (NLP) field has witnessed remarkable advancements with the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Gemini, Claude,\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(COMPANY A<|>GOVERNMENT AGENCY B<|>ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>Company A was found to engage in anti-competitive practices because it was fined for bid rigging in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B according to an article published on 2022/01/10<|>According to an article published on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.)\n## (KAI XIONG<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>SUSPECTED<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>Kai Xiong was suspected of engaging in certain activities according to the paper published on 2023/08/31<|>The paper titled \"Optimizing RAG with Hybrid Search and Contextual Chunking\" by Ashish Bansal discusses Kai Xiong's involvement in unspecified activities.)\n## (LONG CUI<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>SUSPECTED<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>Long Cui was suspected of engaging in certain activities according to the paper published on 2023/08/31<|>The paper titled \"RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT: A PILOT STUDY\" discusses Long Cui's involvement in unspecified activities.)\n## (YIDONG HE<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>SUSPECTED<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>Yidong He was suspected of engaging in certain activities according to the paper published on 2023/08/31<|>The paper titled \"Optimizing RAG with Hybrid Search and Contextual Chunking\" by Ashish Bansal discusses Yidong He's involvement in unspecified activities.)\n## (YONGBIN LIU<|>NONE<|>UNKNOWN CLAIM TYPE<|>SUSPECTED<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>2023-08-31T00:00:00<|>Yongbin Liu was suspected of engaging in certain activities according to the paper published on 2023/08/31<|>The paper titled \"RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT: A PILOT STUDY\" discusses Yongbin Liu's involvement in unspecified activities.)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
