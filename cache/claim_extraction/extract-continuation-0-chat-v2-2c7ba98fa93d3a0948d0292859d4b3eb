Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made.

Recent studies have demonstrated that leveraging the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, combined with Knowledge Graphs that encapsulate extensive factual data in a structured format, robustly enhances the reasoning capabilities of LLMs. However, deploying such systems in real-world scenarios presents challenges: the continuous evolution of non-stationary environments may lead to performance degradation and user satisfaction requires a careful balance of performance and responsiveness. To address these challenges, we introduce a Multi-objective Multi-Armed Bandit enhanced RAG framework, supported by multiple retrieval methods with diverse capabilities under rich and evolving retrieval contexts in practice. Within this framework, each retrieval method is treated as a distinct ``arm''. The system utilizes real-time user feedback to adapt to dynamic environments, by selecting the appropriate retrieval method based on input queries and the historical multi-objective performance of each arm. Extensive experiments conducted on two benchmark KGQA datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baseline methods in non-stationary settings while achieving state-of-the-art performance in stationary environments.

However, this mechanism still produces hallucinations and structural incoherence in knowledge-intensive tasks. Additionally, many existing techniques neither holistically leverage multiple properties of text nor integrate diverse prompting and agenting frameworks. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel methodology that extracts and utilizes unstructured and structured properties of text to construct layered RAG pipelines designed to enhance complex LLM reasoning. Our approach synthesizes three distinct RAG methodologies, each specialized in various aspects: textual entity knowledge graph extraction (Textual Entity RAG); community summary and entity generation (Microsoft GraphRAG), and structural link navigation (MetaWiki RAG). By cumulatively layering these techniques along with advanced prompting and agentic evaluation, we aim to capture a more comprehensive context, enabling the model to generate well-structured responses that reflect all relevant attributes of the text. The proposed framework not only enhances existing RAG mechanisms but also demonstrates the effective integration of knowledge graphs. Additionally, it showcases the application of this framework to advanced answer generation using Wikipedia, with extensions to similar knowledge networks. This novel approach offers a robust solution for social recommender systems and other practical applications, delivering holistic outcomes by synthesizing diverse RAG techniques.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-31,\n    authors: ['Vedanth Aggarwal'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Enhancing Vector based Retrieval Augmented Generation with Contextual Knowledge Graph Construction,\n    abstract: The proliferation of unstructured text data necessitates efficient information retrieval systems.
