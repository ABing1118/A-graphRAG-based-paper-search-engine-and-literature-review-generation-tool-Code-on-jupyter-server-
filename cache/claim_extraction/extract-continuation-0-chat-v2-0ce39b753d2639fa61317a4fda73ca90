Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

In 1986, researcher Don R. Swanson read a collection of scientific articles that spanned different fields of inquiry. Each of these disconnected communities had information valuable to the other, but due to the lack of crosstalk, did not appear to know it. Swanson noticed, in papers produced by researchers interested in Raynaud’s disease, that its symptoms often included increased blood viscosity and rigidity of erythrocytes. Meanwhile, in the nutrition biology community several publications proposed that dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity, without explicitly connecting this finding to Raynaud’s disease. In this early real-world example of synthetic idea generation, Swanson merged these findings to suggest that fish oil can be beneficial for Raynaud’s patients and published his suggestion as a medical hypothesis. The hypothesis was confirmed some years later in an independent randomised clinical trial. Even with current text mining capabilities, such synthetic ideas can be discovered automatically. A more distant but nonetheless realistic aim of the field is to trace and map more sophisticated ideas (idea isomorphisms) that are expressed differently in different scientific fields, yet represent identical problems or their solutions. Were such idea mappings made instantly available through an Internet interface, the result could be truly impressive. The diffusion of innovations across science could be markedly increased by making solutions developed in one area visible to specialists still desperately searching for them in a different field. Computationally pairing problems and solutions generated by different fields is a type of automated creativity (systematic search for synthetic ideas) that computers almost certainly will do for us in the not too distant future.
