Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

In this paper, we present a critical analysis of failure points in existing KG-based RAG methods, identifying eight key areas of concern, including misinterpretation of question context, incorrect relation mapping, and ineffective ambiguity resolution. We argue that these failures primarily stem from design limitations in current KG-RAG systems, such as inadequate attention to discerning user intent and insufficient alignment of retrieved knowledge with the contextual demands of the query. Based on this analysis, we propose a new approach for KG-RAG systems, termed Mindful-RAG, which re-engineers the retrieval process to be more intent-driven and contextually aware. By enhancing reasoning capabilities, improving constraint identification, and addressing the structural limitations of knowledge graphs, we aim to improve the reliability and effectiveness of KG-RAG systems. To validate this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept by integrating the principles of Mindful-RAG into an existing KG-RAG system. The Mindful-RAG approach seeks to deliver more robust, accurate, and contextually aligned AI-driven knowledge retrieval systems, with potential applications in critical domains such as healthcare, legal, research, and scientific discovery, where precision and reliability are paramount.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-16,\n    authors: ['Garima Agrawal', 'Tharindu Kumarage', 'Zeyad Alghamdi', 'Huanmin Liu'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Quantized Large Language Models: A Comparative Analysis,\n    abstract: Large language models have demonstrated emergent intelligence and ability to handle a wide array of tasks. However, the reliability of these models in terms of factual accuracy and timely knowledge acquisition remains a challenge. Researchers explore the implementation of retrieval-augmented generation methods, aiming to enhance the authenticity and specificity in knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper discusses the practical application in industrial settings, particularly in assisting design personnel with navigating complex standards and quality manuals. Utilizing an open-source model with 6 billion parameters, the study employs quantization technology for local deployment, addressing computational challenges. The retrieval-augmented generation framework is analyzed, emphasizing the integration of document parsing, vector databases, and text embedding models. Experimental results compare models at different quantization levels, revealing trade-offs between response time, model size, and performance metrics. The findings suggest that 4-bit integer quantization is optimal for standard document retrieval and question-answering tasks, highlighting practical considerations for CPU inference. The paper concludes with insights into hyper-parameter tuning, model comparisons, and future optimizations for enhanced performance in edge device deployments of large language models.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-11-24,\n    authors: ['Shanglin Yang', 'Jialin Zhu', 'Jialin Wang', 'Xiaohan Xu', 'Zihang Shao', 'Liwei Yao', 'Benchang Zheng', 'Hu Huang'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: KNIMEZoBot: Enhancing Literature Review with Zotero and KNIME OpenAI Integration using Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Academic researchers face challenges keeping up with exponentially growing published findings in their field. Performing comprehensive literature reviews to synthesize knowledge is time-consuming and labor-intensive using manual approaches. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide promising solutions, yet many require coding expertise, limiting accessibility. KNIMEZoBot represents an innovative integration of Zotero, OpenAI, and the KNIME visual programming platform to automate literature review tasks for users with no coding experience. By leveraging KNIME's intuitive graphical interface, researchers can create workflows to search their Zotero libraries and utilize OpenAI models to extract key information without coding. Users simply provide API keys and configure settings through a user-friendly interface in a locally stored copy of the workflow. KNIMEZoBot then allows asking natural language questions via a chatbot and retrieves relevant passages from papers to generate synthesized answers. This system has significant potential to expedite literature reviews for researchers unfamiliar with coding by automating retrieval and analysis of publications in personal Zotero libraries. KNIMEZoBot demonstrates how thoughtfully designed AI tools can expand accessibility and accelerate knowledge building across diverse research domains.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-11-07,\n    authors: ['S.
