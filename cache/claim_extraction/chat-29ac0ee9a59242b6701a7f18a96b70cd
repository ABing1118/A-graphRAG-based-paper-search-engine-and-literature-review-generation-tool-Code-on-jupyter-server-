Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Recently, RAG-end2end model further optimized the architecture and achieved notable performance improvements on domain adaptation. However, the effectiveness of these RAG-based architectures remains relatively unexplored when fine-tuned on specialized domains such as customer service for building a reliable conversational AI system. Furthermore, a critical challenge persists in reducing the occurrence of hallucinations while maintaining high domain-specific accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the performance of diverse RAG and RAG-like architectures through domain adaptation and evaluated their ability to generate accurate and relevant response grounded in the contextual knowledge base. To facilitate the evaluation of the models, we constructed a novel dataset HotelConvQA, sourced from wide range of hotel-related conversations and fine-tuned all the models on our domain specific dataset. We also addressed a critical research gap on determining the impact of domain adaptation on reducing hallucinations across different RAG architectures, an aspect that was not properly measured in prior work. Our evaluation shows positive results in all metrics by employing domain adaptation, demonstrating strong performance on QA tasks and providing insights into their efficacy in reducing hallucinations. Our findings clearly indicate that domain adaptation not only enhances the models' performance on QA tasks but also significantly reduces hallucination across all evaluated RAG architectures.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-23,\n    authors: ['Salman Rakin', 'Md.

They are even applied to generate simulation models for multibody systems from natural language. Research results suggest that LLMs surpass the mere replication of existing code examples, where some LLMs have been trained on an open-source multibody simulation code. However, for closed-source simulation software, such results are not to be expected as their ideas and concepts might differ from other publicly available ones. LLMs can hallucinate for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as model creation, which can lead to wrong responses. This is especially the case for the LLM unknown closed-source simulation software. The same applies to other internal knowledge kept private to protect intellectual property or data privacy. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach might yield a solution for these knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper explores the application of RAG to closed-source simulation software and presents first experiments. After a brief introduction to LLMs, the RAG approach, and the simulation method applied by the close-source simulation software, several examples are provided to test LLMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems. The examples show promising results indicating the benefits of applying RAG systems to closed-source simulation software, helping to access their knowledge. Nevertheless, they also reveal gaps in the applied information and open questions for further research.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-02-06,\n    authors: ['Andreas Baumann', 'Peter Eberhard'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: DuetRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods augment the input of Large Language Models (LLMs) with relevant retrieved passages, reducing factual errors in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, contemporary RAG approaches suffer from irrelevant knowledge retrieval issues in complex domain questions (e.g., HotPot QA) due to the lack of corresponding domain knowledge, leading to low-quality generations. To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, DuetRAG. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously integrate the domain fintuning and RAG models to improve the knowledge retrieval quality, thereby enhancing generation quality. Finally, we demonstrate DuetRAG' s matches with expert human researchers on HotPot QA.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-12,\n    authors: ['Dian Jiao', 'Li\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
