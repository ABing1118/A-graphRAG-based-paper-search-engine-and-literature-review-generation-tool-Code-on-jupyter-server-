Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The powerful generator still tends to generate content even when the LLM does not have sufficient knowledge at all, which is known as the hallucination problem. We find there is a research void in applying LLMs in the vocal training industry, which requires intensive expert knowledge in any chatbot or intelligent tutor services. This paper details employing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology to develop a domain-specific language model, addressing inherent challenges such as hallucination, where large models generate plausible but inaccurate content, and lack of domain specificity. By segmenting the knowledge base and establishing semantic similarities between user queries and knowledge data, the project lays a solid foundation for integrating RAG, significantly improving response accuracy and contextual relevance. The report highlights the successful implementation of RAG, enhancing system intelligence and personalization for user-specific needs, discusses challenges and solutions during the implementation process, and outlines future directions to expand RAG capabilities and improve user experiences.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-16,\n    authors: ['Chun-hung Jonas Leung', 'Yicheng Yi', 'Le Kuai', 'Zongxi Li', 'Siu-Kei Au Yeung', 'Kwok-wah John Lee', 'Ka-him Kelvin Ho', 'Kevin Hung'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Distill-SynthKG: Distilling Knowledge Graph Synthesis Workflow for Improved Coverage and Efficiency,\n    abstract: Knowledge graphs (KGs) generated by large language models (LLMs\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
