Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This problem hinders their potential for building truly conversational applications. To address this problem, we propose an approach to integrating memory into LLMs using GraphRAG, which is a framework that leverages Knowledge Graph and Retrieval Augmented Generation techniques for retrieving historical interactions. By representing the key knowledge contained in the dialogue history as a knowledge graph, we can capture complex relationships between entities and concepts mentioned in previous turns. We also introduce a mechanism for effectively accessing relevant nodes with the current query, allowing for more focused and efficient recall of past interactions. We evaluate our approach on benchmark datasets for question answering, text summarization, and dialogue systems, demonstrating significant improvements in performance compared to baseline LLMs. Our findings highlight the potential of GraphRAG as a powerful tool for equipping LLMs with robust memory capabilities, paving the way for more sophisticated and context-aware AI applications,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-06,\n    authors: ['Tie Li'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: Tokenvizz: GraphRAG-Inspired Tokenization Tool for Genomic Data Discovery and Visualization,\n    abstract: Summary One of the primary challenges in biomedical research is the interpretation of complex genomic relationships and the prediction of functional interactions across the genome. Tokenvizz is a novel tool for genomic analysis that enhances data discovery and visualization by combining GraphRAG-inspired tokenization with graph-based modeling. In Tokenvizz, genomic sequences are represented as graphs, where sequence k-mers (tokens) serve as nodes and attention scores as edge weights, enabling researchers to visually interpret complex, non-linear relationships within DNA sequences. Through a web-based visualization interface, researchers can interactively explore these genomic relationships and extract biologically meaningful insights about regulatory patterns and functional elements. Applied to promoter-enhancer interaction prediction tasks, Tokenvizz outperformed traditional sequential models while\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
