Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2.

Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

We propose GRAFT (Graph Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning), a novel approach that combines the strengths of the Retrieval Augmented Fine-Tuning (RAFT) methodology and the GraphRAG technique. GRAFT fine-tunes large language models (LLMs) on a simulated imperfect retrieval setting, training the model to identify relevant documents and ignore distractors in the provided context. The model is then coupled with graphRAG at inference. To investigate the effectiveness of the GRAFT methodology, we constructed a knowledge graph using 74 Wikipedia source documents and extracted communities within this graph. We then summarized these communities, leveraging local and global relationships between documents for retrieval, fine-tuned a Microsoft Phi-2 model using the RAFT approach on a subset of the HotPotQA dataset, and evaluated its performance on a custom set of multi-hop and global questions generated from Wikipedia articles published in 2024. Our experimental results demonstrate that GRAFT outperforms baseline models, including the Baseline RAG model, the RAFT model, and the Baseline GraphRAG model, across various evaluation metrics like BERT, BLEU, ROUGE-1, and Semantic Similarity. In particular, GRAFT achieves the highest scores on global questions, showcasing its effectiveness in query-focused summarization tasks that require understanding broad themes and contexts over large document corpora.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Sonya Jin', 'Sunny Yu', 'Natalia Kokoromyti'],\n    score: 50\n\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## \n\nORGANIZATION LEGO-GraphRAG<|>NONE<|>INNOVATION IN INFORMATION RETRIEVAL AND SUMMARIZATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-01T00:00:00<|>2024-12-31T00:00:00<|>The GRAFT methodology combines the strengths of RAFT and GraphRAG to improve multi-hop reasoning and global query-focused summarization tasks over large document corpora.
