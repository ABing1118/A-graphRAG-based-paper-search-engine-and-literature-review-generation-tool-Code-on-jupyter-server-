Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

We focus on two inference scaling strategies: in-context learning and iterative prompting. These strategies provide additional flexibility to scale test-time computation (e.g., by increasing retrieved documents or generation steps), thereby enhancing LLMs' ability to effectively acquire and utilize contextual information. We address two key questions: (1) How does RAG performance benefit from the scaling of inference computation when optimally configured? (2) Can we predict the optimal test-time compute allocation for a given budget by modeling the relationship between RAG performance and inference parameters? Our observations reveal that increasing inference computation leads to nearly linear gains in RAG performance when optimally allocated, a relationship we describe as the inference scaling laws for RAG. Building on this, we further develop the computation allocation model to estimate RAG performance across different inference configurations. The model predicts optimal inference parameters under various computation constraints, which align closely with the experimental results. By applying these optimal configurations, we demonstrate that scaling inference compute on long-context LLMs achieves up to 58.9% gains on benchmark datasets compared to standard RAG.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 4,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-10-06\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2028213158\",\n        \"name\": \"Zhenrui Yue\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"39371343\",\n        \"name\": \"Honglei Zhuang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2324782053\",\n        \"name\": \"Aijun Bai\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2261281337\",\n        \"name\": \"Kai Hui\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"1886219\",\n        \"name\": \"R.

Off-the-shelf RAG flows are well pretrained on general-purpose documents, yet they encounter significant challenges when being applied to knowledge-intensive vertical domains, such as electronic design automation (EDA). This paper addresses such issue by proposing a customized RAG framework along with three domain-specific techniques for EDA tool documentation QA, including a contrastive learning scheme for text embedding model fine-tuning, a reranker distilled from proprietary LLM, and a generative LLM fine-tuned with high-quality domain corpus. Furthermore, we have developed and released a documentation QA evaluation benchmark, ORD-QA, for OpenROAD, an advanced RTL-to-GDSII design platform. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed RAG flow and techniques have achieved superior performance on ORD-QA as well as on a commercial tool, compared with state-of-the-arts. The ORD-QA benchmark and the training dataset for our customized RAG flow are open-source at https://github.com/lesliepy99/RAG-EDA.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 3,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-07-22\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2220363044\",\n        \"name\": \"Yuan Pu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"8822971\",\n        \"name\": \"Zhuolun He\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2312323764\",\n        \"name\": \"Tairu Qiu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2275801674\",\n        \"name\": \"Haoyuan Wu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2257320153\",\n        \"name\": \"Bei Yu\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 90.79441541679836\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"43d35e1c866bbcfa3c573d69df217c35fcec27b2\",\n    \"\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA)\n\n- **Paper ID**: 5c538b02e876fd39f8a60907a792556f73fb74b0\n- **Title**: Customized Retrieval Augmented Generation and Benchmarking for EDA Tool Documentation QA\n- **Abstract**: This paper addresses the issue of applying off-the-shelf RAG flows to knowledge-intensive vertical domains, such as electronic design automation (EDA), by proposing a customized RAG framework along with three domain-specific techniques.
