Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

In this paper, we introduce SMART-SLIC, a highly domain-specific LLM framework, that integrates RAG with KG and a vector store (VS) that store factual domain specific information. Importantly, to avoid hallucinations in the KG, we build these highly domain-specific KGs and VSs without the use of LLMs, but via NLP, data mining, and nonnegative tensor factorization with automatic model selection. Pairing our RAG with a domain-specific: (i) KG (containing structured information), and (ii) VS (containing unstructured information) enables the development of domain-specific chat-bots that attribute the source of information, mitigate hallucinations, lessen the need for fine-tuning, and excel in highly domain-specific question answering tasks. We pair SMART-SLIC with chain-of-thought prompting agents. The framework is designed to be generalizable to adapt to any specific or specialized domain. In this paper, we demonstrate the question answering capabilities of our framework on a corpus of scientific publications on malware analysis and anomaly detection.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-03,\n    authors: ['Ryan Barron', 'Ves Grantcharov', 'Selma Wanna', 'M.

Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLMs with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines, especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval-augmented generation.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-02,\n    authors: ['Youna Kim', 'Hyuhng Joon Kim', 'Cheonbok Park', 'Choonghyun Park', 'Hyunsoo Cho', 'Junyeob Kim', 'Kang Min Yoo', 'Sang-goo Lee', 'Taeuk Kim'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: Mindful-RAG: A Study of Points of Failure in Retrieval Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text but often struggle with knowledge-intensive queries, particularly in domain-specific and factual question-answering tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution by integrating external knowledge sources, such as structured knowledge graphs (KGs). While KG-based RAG approaches have demonstrated value, current state-of-the-art solutions frequently fall short, failing to deliver accurate and reliable answers even when the necessary factual knowledge is available. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of failure points in existing KG-based RAG methods, identifying eight key areas of concern, including misinterpretation of question context, incorrect relation mapping, and ineffective ambiguity resolution. We argue that these failures primarily stem from design limitations in current KG-RAG systems, such as inadequate attention to discerning user intent and insufficient alignment of retrieved knowledge with the contextual demands of the query. Based on this analysis, we propose a new approach for KG-RAG systems, termed Mindful-RAG, which re-engineers the retrieval process to be more intent-driven and contextually aware. By enhancing reasoning capabilities, improving constraint identification, and addressing the structural limitations of knowledge graphs, we aim to improve the reliability and effectiveness of KG-RAG systems. To validate this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept by integrating the principles of Mindful-RAG into an existing KG-RAG system. The Mindful-RAG approach seeks to deliver more robust, accurate, and contextually aligned AI-driven knowledge retrieval systems, with potential applications in critical domains such as healthcare, legal, research, and scientific discovery, where precision and reliability are paramount.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-16,\n    authors: ['Garima Agrawal', 'Tharindu Kumarage', '\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
