{"result": "It seems like you're referring to a situation where many entities were missed during an extraction process, but you haven't provided specific details about which entities are missing or the context of this extraction. To provide accurate assistance, I would need more information such as:\n\n1. **The type of data being extracted**: Is it text, images, audio, etc.?\n2. **The method or tool used for extraction**: Was it manual, automated using software, machine learning models, etc.?\n3. **The context of the extraction**: What is the purpose of extracting these entities? Are they part of a database, knowledge graph, or some other structured data set?\n\nGiven this information would allow me to provide more specific guidance on how to identify and add missed entities:\n\n- **Reviewing the Extraction Process**: Check if there were any limitations in the extraction method that might have led to missing entities. For instance, if using machine learning models, ensure they are trained with a diverse enough dataset.\n  \n- **Manual Review**: Sometimes, manually reviewing the data can help identify patterns or errors that automated systems might miss.\n\n- **Using Additional Tools**: Consider utilizing additional tools designed for entity extraction such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) tools in natural language processing (NLP), which can be particularly helpful if dealing with text-based data.\n\n- **Feedback Loop**: Implement a feedback loop where users can report missed entities, and this information is used to improve the extraction process over time.\n\nIf you could provide more details about these aspects, I would be able to offer more targeted advice on how to address the issue of missing entities in your specific scenario.", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. The quality of constructed KGs may also impact the performance of some KG-dependent domains like GraphRAG systems and recommendation systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in addressing a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, there are still challenges when utilizing LLMs to address the task of generating structured KGs. And we have identified three limitations with respect to existing KG construction methods. (1)There is a large amount of information and excessive noise in real-world documents, which could result in extracting messy information. (2)Native LLMs struggle to effectively extract accuracy knowledge from some domain-specific documents. (3)Hallucinations phenomenon cannot be overlooked when utilizing LLMs directly as an unsupervised method for constructing KGs. In this paper, we propose GraphJudger, a knowledge graph construction framework to address the aforementioned challenges. We introduce three innovative modules in our method, which are entity-centric iterative text denoising, knowledge aware instruction tuning and graph judgement, respectively. We seek to utilize the capacity of LLMs to function as a graph judger, a capability superior to their role only as a predictor for KG construction problems. Experiments conducted on two general text-graph pair datasets and one domain-specific text-graph pair dataset show superior performances compared to baseline methods.
