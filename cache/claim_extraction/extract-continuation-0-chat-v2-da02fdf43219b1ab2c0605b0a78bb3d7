Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

Meanwhile, post-processing by the adversary's deployed LLMs typically destructs text watermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box\"knowledge watermark\"approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of RAGs. RAG-WM uses a multi-LLM interaction framework, comprising a Watermark Generator, Shadow LLM&RAG, and Watermark Discriminator, to create watermark texts based on watermark entity-relationship tuples and inject them into the target RAG. We evaluate RAG-WM across three domain-specific and two privacy-sensitive tasks on four benchmark LLMs. Experimental results show that RAG-WM effectively detects the stolen RAGs in various deployed LLMs. Furthermore, RAG-WM is robust against paraphrasing, unrelated content removal, knowledge insertion, and knowledge expansion attacks. Lastly, RAG-WM can also evade watermark detection approaches, highlighting its promising application in detecting IP infringement of RAG systems.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-01-09,\n    authors: ['Peizhuo Lv', 'Mengjie Sun', 'Hao Wang', 'Xiaofeng Wang', 'Shengzhi Zhang', 'Yuxuan Chen', 'Kai Chen', 'Limin Sun'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: RAG-DDR: Optimizing Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Differentiable Data Rewards,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has proven its effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) by retrieving knowledge from external resources. To adapt LLMs for RAG pipelines, current approaches use instruction tuning to optimize LLMs, improving their ability to utilize retrieved knowledge. This supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approach focuses on equipping LLMs to handle diverse RAG tasks using different instructions. However, it trains RAG modules to overfit training signals and overlooks the varying data preferences among agents within the RAG system. In this paper, we propose a Differentiable Data Rewards (DDR) method, which end-to-end trains RAG systems by aligning data preferences between different RAG modules. DDR works by collecting the rewards to optimize each agent with a rollout method. This method prompts agents to sample some potential responses as perturbations, evaluates the impact of these perturbations on the whole RAG system, and subsequently optimizes the agent to produce outputs that improve the performance of the RAG system. Our experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks demonstrate that DDR significantly outperforms the SFT method, particularly for LLMs with smaller-scale parameters that depend more on the retrieved knowledge. Additionally, DDR exhibits a stronger capability to align the data preference between RAG modules. The DDR method makes generation module more effective in extracting key information from documents and mitigating conflicts between parametric memory and external knowledge.

However, current RAG methods often fall short of ensuring the depth and completeness of retrieved information, which is necessary for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we introduce Think-on-Graph 2.0 (ToG-2), a hybrid RAG framework that iteratively retrieves information from both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in a tight-coupling manner. Specifically, ToG-2 leverages knowledge graphs (KGs) to link documents via entities, facilitating deep and knowledge-guided context retrieval. Simultaneously, it utilizes documents as entity contexts to achieve precise and efficient graph retrieval. ToG-2 alternates between graph retrieval and context retrieval to search for in-depth clues relevant to the question, enabling LLMs to generate answers. We conduct a series of well-designed experiments to highlight the following advantages of ToG-2: 1) ToG-2 tightly couples the processes of context retrieval and graph retrieval, deepening context retrieval via the KG while enabling reliable graph retrieval based on contexts; 2) it achieves deep\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Combining the information from all three papers):\n\n**Paper 1: RAG-WM**\n\nTitle: A Novel Black-Box Knowledge Watermark Approach for Detecting Intellectual Property Infringement in Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems\n\nAbstract:\nRAG-WM is a proposed solution to address issues with relational database watermarks and post-processing by deployed LLMs that typically destroy text watermark information.
