Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

We also explored how additional relevant knowledge from Wikipedia added to the context-window of the LLM might improve their performance. Mixtral 8x7b was competitive in the 10-shot setting, both with and without fine-tuning, but failed to produce usable results in the zero-shot setting. QLoRa fine-tuning and Wikipedia context did not lead to measurable performance gains. Our results indicate that the performance gap between commercial and open-source models in RAG setups exists mainly in the zero-shot setting and can be closed by simply collecting few-shot examples for domain-specific use cases.

Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. However, they often suffer from limitations such as difficulty in incorporating new knowledge, generating hallucinations, and explaining their reasoning process. To address these challenges, integrating knowledge graphs with Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) has emerged as an effective solution. Traditional Graph RAG methods often rely on simple graph traversal or semantic similarity, which do not capture causal relationships or align well with the model's internal reasoning steps. This paper proposes a novel pipeline that filters large knowledge graphs to emphasize cause-effect edges, aligns the retrieval process with the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), and enhances reasoning through multi-stage path improvements. Experiments on medical question-answering tasks show consistent gains, with up to a 10\\% absolute improvement across multiple large language models (LLMs). This approach demonstrates the value of combining causal reasoning with stepwise retrieval, leading to more interpretable and logically grounded solutions for complex queries.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-01-24,\n    authors: ['Hang Luo', 'Jian Zhang', 'Chujun Li'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: A graph-based approach to closed-domain natural language generation,\n    abstract: Graph-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods have seen significant advancements in recent years with the development of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). LLMs are sophisticated models that recognize numerous NLP tasks by analyzing the users' natural language instructions called prompts. However, their industrial use is questionable due to such ethical concerns as false information generation called hallucinations, high risks of data breaches, and plagiarism. The paper introduces a novel NLP architecture, the Graph-Based Block-to-Block Generation (G3BG), which leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the power of attention mechanisms, distributional semantics, graph-based information retrieval, and decentralized networks. The model encodes user prompts to mitigate data breach risk, retrieves relevant information from a graph knowledge base, and forms a block for a conditional language model using LLMs to perform a new secure type of RAG. The model is closed-domain and small-scale oriented. It exhibits superior performance across low-resource NLP tasks, which makes it prominent for industrial use. The research presents a novel graph-based dataset. The dataset comprises private data features to encode and closed-domain textual information for information retrieval. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the G3BG model. The model allows cutting 100x training dataset volume achieving Perplexity ~6.51 on the Language Generation task and F1-Score ~90.3 on the Information Retrieval task comparable to most state-of-the-art language models. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method and contribute to the algorithmic approaches toward LLM risk mitigation.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-09-30,\n    authors: ['Victoria I.
