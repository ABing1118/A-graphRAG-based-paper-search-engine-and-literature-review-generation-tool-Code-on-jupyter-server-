The claims might include:\n\n1. **Claim**: TechCorp has been accused of violating environmental regulations.\n   - Subject: TechCorp\n   - Object: Environmental regulators\n   - Claim Type: Violation of Regulations\n   - Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n   - Claim Description: The claim is based on an ongoing investigation by several state and federal agencies into TechCorp's operations, which are suspected to have caused significant environmental damage.\n   - Claim Date: 2023-01-01T00:00:00 - 2023-06-30T00:00:00\n   - Claim Source Text: \"TechCorp is under investigation for potential violations of environmental regulations following reports of pollution in several local waterways.\"\n\n2. **Claim**: John Doe, CEO of TechCorp, has been criticized for his management style.\n   - Subject: John Doe\n   - Object: Employees and shareholders\n   - Claim Type: Criticism of Management Style\n   - Claim Status: TRUE\n   - Claim Description: Multiple employees and shareholders have publicly expressed concerns about the leadership style under which TechCorp operates, citing issues such as lack of transparency and poor communication.\n   - Claim Date: 2023-01-01T00:00:00 - Present\n   - Claim Source Text: \"TechCorp's CEO has faced criticism from both employees and shareholders regarding his management style, which is perceived as autocratic.\"\n\n3. **Claim**: The United States government is considering imposing sanctions on TechCorp.\n   - Subject: United States Government\n   - Object: TechCorp\n   - Claim Type: Threat of Sanctions\n   - Claim Status: SUSPECTED\n   - Claim Description: There are indications that the U.S. Department of Commerce might consider imposing trade sanctions against TechCorp due to allegations of unfair business practices and potential national security risks.\n   - Claim Date: 2023-04-01T00:00:00 - Present\n   - Claim Source Text: \"TechCorp is reportedly under scrutiny by the U.S. Department of Commerce, which could lead to sanctions if evidence supports claims of unfair trade practices.\"\n\nPlease note that these examples are hypothetical and based on fabricated information for demonstration purposes only.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, regarding how to obtain effective documents, the existing methods are mainly divided into two categories. One is to retrieve from an external knowledge base, and the other is to utilize large language models to generate documents. We propose an iterative retrieval-generation collaborative framework. It is not only able to leverage both parametric and non-parametric knowledge, but also helps to find the correct reasoning path through retrieval-generation interactions, which is very important for tasks that require multi-step reasoning. We conduct experiments on four question answering datasets, including single-hop QA and multi-hop QA tasks. Empirical results show that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of large language models and outperforms previous baselines.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-10-08,\n    authors: ['Zhangyin Feng', 'Xiaocheng Feng', 'Dezhi Zhao', 'Maojin Yang', 'Bing Qin'],\n    score: 123.67080745521918\n},\n{\n    title: FiDO: Fusion-in-Decoder optimized for stronger performance and faster inference,\n    abstract: Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) is a powerful retrieval-augmented language model that sets the state-of-the-art on many knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. However, the architecture used for FiD was chosen by making minimal modifications to a standard T5 model, which our analysis shows to be highly suboptimal for a retrieval-augmented model. In particular, FiD allocates the bulk of FLOPs to the encoder, while the majority of inference time results from memory bandwidth constraints in the decoder.
