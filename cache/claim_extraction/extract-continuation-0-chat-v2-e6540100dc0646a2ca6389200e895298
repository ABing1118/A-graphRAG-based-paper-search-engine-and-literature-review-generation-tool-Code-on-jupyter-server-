Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

This study explores the role of external knowledge in the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to improve the performance of zero-shot cross-lingual transfer. This paper proposes a new model architecture that enriches the knowledge base of the RAG model by integrating external knowledge bases, thereby enhancing its information bridging capabilities between source and target languages. In the experimental section, this paper conducts experiments using multiple cross-language tasks, including machine translation, question answering, and text summarization, to evaluate the performancen and domain of the model in different languages. The experimental results indicate that introducing external knowledge sources significantly improves the accuracy and robustness of the model, especially in resource-scarce language pairs. This research not only provides an effective solution for zero-shot cross-language transfer, but also provides new\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
