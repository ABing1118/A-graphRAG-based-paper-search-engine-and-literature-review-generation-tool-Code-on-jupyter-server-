Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

This study introduces LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking, a novel approach designed to enhance the factual reliability of LLMs, with a focus on medical question answering (QA). LEAF utilizes a dual strategy to enhance the factual accuracy of responses from models such as Llama 3 70B Instruct and Llama 3 8B Instruct. The first strategy, Fact-Check-Then-RAG, improves Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by incorporating fact-checking results to guide the retrieval process without updating model parameters. The second strategy, Learning from Fact-Checks via Self-Training, involves supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on fact-checked responses or applying Simple Preference Optimization (SimPO) with fact-checking as a ranking mechanism, both updating LLM parameters from supervision. These findings suggest that integrating fact-checked responses whether through RAG enhancement or self-training enhances the reliability and factual correctness of LLM outputs, offering a promising solution for applications where information accuracy is crucial.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-31,\n    authors: ['Hieu Tran', 'Junda Wang', 'Yujan Ting', 'Weijing Huang', 'Terrence Chen'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title:\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n\nORGANIZATION LEAF<|>NONE<|>IMPROVEMENT IN QUESTION-ANSWERING TASKS<|>TRUE<|>2024-06-18T00:00:00<|>2024-06-18T00:00:00<|>The LEAF model significantly boosts performance in question-answering tasks within the RAG framework, demonstrating the potential of LLMs to economically and effectively train smaller models according to a study published on 2024/06/18<|>The publication titled \"LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking to Improve Factualness in Large Language Models\" was published on 2024/06/18.\n\nORGANIZATION LEAF<|>NONE<|>ENHANCEMENT OF FACTUAL RELIABILITY IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>TRUE<|>2024-10-31T00:00:00<|>2024-10-31T00:00:00<|>The LEAF model enhances the factual reliability of large language models, particularly in medical question answering (QA), by integrating fact-checking results to guide the retrieval process without updating model parameters according to a study published on 2024/10/31<|>The publication titled \"LEAF: Learning and Evaluation Augmented by Fact-Checking to Improve Factualness in Large Language Models\" was published on 2024/10/31.\n\n##"}]}
