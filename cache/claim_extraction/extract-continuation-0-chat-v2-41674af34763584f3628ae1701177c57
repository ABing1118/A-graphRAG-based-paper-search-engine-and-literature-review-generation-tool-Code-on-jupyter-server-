Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The retrieval-augmented generation framework is analyzed, emphasizing the integration of document parsing, vector databases, and text embedding models. Experimental results compare models at different quantization levels, revealing trade-offs between response time, model size, and performance metrics. The findings suggest that 4-bit integer quantization is optimal for standard document retrieval and question-answering tasks, highlighting practical considerations for CPU inference.

Performing comprehensive literature reviews to synthesize knowledge is time-consuming and labor-intensive using manual approaches. Recent advances in artificial intelligence provide promising solutions, yet many require coding expertise, limiting accessibility. KNIMEZoBot represents an innovative integration of Zotero, OpenAI, and the KNIME visual programming platform to automate literature review tasks for users with no coding experience. By leveraging KNIME's intuitive graphical interface, researchers can create workflows to search their Zotero libraries and utilize OpenAI models to extract key information without coding. Users simply provide API keys and configure settings through a user-friendly interface in a locally stored copy of the workflow. KNIMEZoBot then allows asking natural language questions via a chatbot and retrieves relevant passages from papers to generate synthesized answers. This system has significant potential to expedite literature reviews for researchers unfamiliar with coding by automating retrieval and analysis of publications in personal Zotero libraries.

We introduce GeneRAG, a frame-work that enhances LLMs’ gene-related capabilities using RAG and the Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) algorithm. Evaluations with datasets from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) show that GeneRAG outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with a 39% improvement in answering gene questions, a 43% performance increase in cell type annotation, and a 0.25 decrease in error rates for gene interaction prediction.
