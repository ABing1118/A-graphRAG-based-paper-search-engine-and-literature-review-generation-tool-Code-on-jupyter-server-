Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Cf. Stock and Strapparava (2005) on the HAHA project, whose purpose is the humorous interpretation of acronyms. As to connotations, Strapparava and Valitutti (2004) described an affective extension of WordNet. 2 FUNCTIONS IN GALLURA The GALLURA project seeks to develop software that would interpret in Hebrew names by folketymology, but in the context of a generated narrative (aetiological tales, usually brief or even very brief). The most closely studied model is a large textual corpus of playfully creative writing that embodies midrashic literary devices, by explaining fancifully place-names of names for animal kinds. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, requires, among the other things, capabilities of story-generation, and of generating a playful explanation. By themselves, these two tasks draw upon three areas in AI: explanation synthesis (for which, see e.g. Schank, 1986, 1994; Walton, 2004), story-generation (see e.g. Liu and Singh, 2002; LÃ¶nneker et al., 2005; and a long survey in Nissan, 2011a: Ch. 5), and computational humour (see e.g. Stock et al., 2002; Ritchie, 2004; Waller et al., 2009). Humour studies are interdisciplinary. Moreover, GALLURA needs skills from computational linguistics, including some that thus far were modelled by linguistics, but not computationally: folk-etymology (see e.g. Kirwin, 1985; Coates, 1994; Baldinger, 1973; Zuckermann, 2006), and phono-semantic matching (PSM), a discussion of which is found in Zuckermann (2000, 200\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
