Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution by integrating external knowledge sources, such as structured knowledge graphs (KGs). While KG-based RAG approaches have demonstrated value, current state-of-the-art solutions frequently fall short, failing to deliver accurate and reliable answers even when the necessary factual knowledge is available. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of failure points in existing KG-based RAG methods, identifying eight key areas of concern, including misinterpretation of question context, incorrect relation mapping, and ineffective ambiguity resolution. We argue that these failures primarily stem from design limitations in current KG-RAG systems, such as inadequate attention to discerning user intent and insufficient alignment of retrieved knowledge with the contextual demands of the query. Based on this analysis, we propose a new approach for KG-RAG systems, termed Mindful-RAG, which re-engineers the retrieval process to be more intent-driven and contextually aware. By enhancing reasoning capabilities, improving constraint identification, and addressing the structural limitations of knowledge graphs, we aim to improve the reliability and effectiveness of KG-RAG systems. To validate this approach, we developed a proof-of-concept by integrating the principles of Mindful-RAG into an existing KG-RAG system. The Mindful-RAG approach seeks to deliver more robust, accurate, and contextually aligned AI-driven knowledge retrieval systems, with potential applications in critical domains such as healthcare, legal, research, and scientific discovery, where precision and reliability are paramount.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-07-16,\n    authors: ['Garima Agrawal', 'Tharindu Kumarage', '\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The input text provided does not contain any explicit claims against specific entities that match the given entity specification ('organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event') or relevant facts that could be considered as claims.
