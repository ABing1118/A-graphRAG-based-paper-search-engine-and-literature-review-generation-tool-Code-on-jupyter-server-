Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Traditional vector-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) models often fail to capture complex relationships and contextual nuances, limiting effectiveness in knowledge-intensive tasks. We introduce Contextual Knowledge Graph Construction (CKGC), a novel approach enhancing vector-based RAG by dynamically building a knowledge graph that reflects inherent data structures and connections.CKGC leverages text chunking, large language models (LLMs), and ontology mapping. By segmenting text and using LLMs to identify key entities and relationships, CKGC constructs a contextualized knowledge graph enriching information representation. This bridges the gap between semantic similarity and deeper contextual understanding, enabling more accurate and nuanced retrieval.Experiments on 2,000 lease agreements demonstrate that CKGC significantly improves vector-based RAG in information retrieval and question answering tasks, with substantial gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Top-k Accuracy. CKGC’s adaptability across domains positions it as a valuable tool for enhancing performance and understanding of complex textual data. Our findings underscore CKGC’s transformative potential in unlocking insights from vast text corpora, paving the way for more intelligent and context-aware information retrieval systems.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-11-29,\n    authors: ['Sagar Mankari', 'Abhishek Sanghavi'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Leveraging the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation Models for Question Answering\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
