Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

DataONE (Observation Network for Earth) represents a new virtual organisation whose goal is to enable new science and knowledge creation through universal access to data about life on earth and the environment that sustains it. DataONE is designed to be the foundation for new innovative environmental science through a distributed framework and sustainable cyberinfrastructure that meets the needs of science and society for open, persistent, robust, and secure access to well-described and easily discovered Earth observational data. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation, DataONE will ensure the preservation and access to multi-scale, multi-discipline, and multi-national science data. DataONE is transdisciplinary, making biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; making environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; providing secure and long-term preservation and access; and engaging scientists, land-managers, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Curated databases 34 policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualisations. Most importantly, DataONE will serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network. DataONE is a five-year project that began in 2009. I identify key environmental scientific, cyberinfrastructure, and sociocultural challenges and provides a road map for how DataONE is addressing these challenges. Specific examples are based on a DataONE EVA (Exploration, Visualisation and Analysis) Working Group effort to create an integrated database that can be used for better understanding the ecology of bird migrations. The important message is that to succeed in international preservation and access to data we need to recognise the importance of data from the perspective of the scientists to understand the requirements. Scientists want fast access in terms of data and tool discovery, automated/automatic metadata annotation and rapid analysis via appropriate visualisation. They want easy access in terms of data and metadata upload; integrated, linked, and synthesised databases\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(COMPANY A<|>GOVERNMENT AGENCY B<|>ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>Company A was found to engage in anti-competitive practices because it was fined for bid rigging in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B according to an article published on 2022/01/10<|>According to an article published on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.)\n##(ORGANIZATION DATAONE<|>NONE<|>ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE INNOVATION<|>TRUE<|>2009-01-01T00:00:00<|>2014-12-31T00:00:00<|>DataONE represents a new virtual organization designed to enable new science and knowledge creation through universal access to data about life on earth and the environment that sustains it.
