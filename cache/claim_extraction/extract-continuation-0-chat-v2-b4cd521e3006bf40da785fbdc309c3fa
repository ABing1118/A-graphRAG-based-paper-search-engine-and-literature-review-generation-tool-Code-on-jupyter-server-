Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to address this issue by integrating external knowledge, enhancing the factual accuracy of outputs. However, naive RAG encounters challenges in effectively utilizing retrieved content, particularly in specialized domains like biomedicine. LLMs often struggle to integrate retrieved content as irrelevant information can interfere with the model’s judgment. Even if relevant documents are retrieved, the model may be unable to accurately comprehend and utilize the domain-specific features due to its inherent knowledge limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Document Embeddings Enhanced Biomedical RAG (DEEB-RAG), a framework that incorporates document embeddings along with the original retrieved text. DEEB-RAG uses MedCPT to generate document embeddings and these embeddings are then aligned with the LLM’s semantic space using a two-stage training process on a simple projector. Experimental results on biomedical QA datasets show that DEEB-RAG improves accuracy, with an average performance increase of 2.3% over naive RAG. This demonstrates DEEB-RAG’s ability to mitigate the challenges of utilizing complex biomedical information, thereby enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in biomedical domain.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-03,\n    authors: ['Yongle Kong', 'Zhihao Yang', 'Ling Luo', 'Zeyuan Ding', 'Lei Wang', 'Wei Liu', 'Yin Zhang', 'Bo Xu', 'Jian Wang', 'Yuanyuan Sun', 'Zhehuan Zhao', 'Hongfei Lin'],\n    score: 76\n},\n{\n    title: Adapting Large Language Models for Biomedicine though Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Documents Scoring,\n    abstract: By integrating the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external biomedical knowledge repositories, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers significant potential for addressing knowledge-intensive biomedical tasks, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of clinical decision-making. However, the standard RAG approach fails to fully leverage the information within the retrieved documents, which can lead to incorrect response generation. While advanced RAG approaches empower LLMs to understand the correlation between queries and documents, they require costly annotation.
