{"result": "To address this issue, I will re-examine the text document with a focus on identifying any additional named entities that match the predefined entity specifications ('organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event') and extract claims against those entities if they are relevant. Here's how you can proceed:\n\n1. **Identify Entities**: Carefully read through the text to identify all entities that might be related to organizations, persons, geographical locations, or events.\n\n2. **Check Relevance**: Ensure each entity identified is relevant to the context and matches one of the predefined entity types ('organization', 'person', 'geo', 'event').\n\n3. **Extract Claims**: For each entity found, extract claims that are associated with it based on the claim description provided. Make sure to capture all necessary information for each claim as outlined in the steps:\n\n   - Subject: Name of the entity that committed the action.\n   - Object: Name of the entity that either reports/handles or is affected by the action (or use **NONE** if unknown).\n   - Claim Type: Overall category of the claim, capitalized and repeatable across similar claims.\n   - Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED** based on evidence provided in the text.\n   - Claim Description: Detailed explanation with related evidence and references from the text.\n   - Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Use ISO-8601 format for dates.\n   - Claim Source Text: List of all relevant quotes from the original text.\n\n4. **Format Claims**: Format each extracted claim using the provided template:\n\n   ```\n   <subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>\n   ```\n\n5. **List Claims**: Compile all claims into a single list, separating each with a double newline (`##`) as shown in the example.\n\n6. **Finalize Output**: Ensure that your final output is properly formatted and includes all relevant information for each claim.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to identify and extract any missed entities from the text document and provide their associated claims according to the guidelines provided.", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

A Comprehensive Study,\n    abstract: Large decoder-only language models (LMs) can be largely improved in terms of perplexity by retrieval (e.g., RETRO), but its impact on text generation quality and downstream task accuracy is unclear. Thus, it is still an open question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural Question) and significantly\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
