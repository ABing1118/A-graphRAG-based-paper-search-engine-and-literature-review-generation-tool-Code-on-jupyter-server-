Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

The real world in which they operate, however, is full of complexity, ambiguity, and uncertainty. In this year’s Turing Lecture, Professor Chris Bishop discusses the field of machine learning, and shows how uncertainty can be modelled and quantified using probabilities. Professor Bishop will look at the recent developments in probabilistic modelling that have greatly expanded the variety and scale of machine learning applications, and he explores the future potential for this technology. 4.2 Integrative Analysis of Pathology, Radiology and High Throughput Molecular Data Joel Saltz, Center for Comprehensive Informatics, Emory University The talk is available at: http://www.nesc.ac.uk/action/esi/download.cfm?index=4459. Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Text mining, computational biology and human disease 32 Integrative analysis of multiple complementary types of information is playing an increasingly essential role in biomedical research. The Emory led caBIG In Silico Brain Tumor Research Center is an excellent example of this. The effort is designed to leverage complementary molecular, pathology, radiology and outcome data, obtained by several large scale National Cancer Institute studies including the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) study. This group is developing workflows consisting of novel image analysis algorithms and bioinformatics analyses to correlate imaging characteristics defined by Pathology and Radiology derived feature sets with underlying “omic” characteristics and with patient outcome. This effort is explicitly designed both to motivate advances in informatics and to generate useful brain tumour research results.
