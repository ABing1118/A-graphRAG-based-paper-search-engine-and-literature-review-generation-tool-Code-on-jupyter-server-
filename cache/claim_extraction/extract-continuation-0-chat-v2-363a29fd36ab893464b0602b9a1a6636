However, to provide precise and relevant information in response to specific customer queries in industry settings, LLMs require access to a comprehensive knowledge base to avoid hallucinations. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) emerges as a promising technique to address this challenge. Yet, developing an accurate question-answering framework for real-world applications using RAG entails several challenges: 1) data availability issues, 2) evaluating the quality of generated content, and 3) the costly nature of human evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases. Given a customer query, the proposed system retrieves relevant knowledge documents and leverages them, along with previous chat history, to generate response suggestions for customer service agents in the contact centers of a major retail company. Through comprehensive automated and human evaluations, we show that this solution outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance. Our findings suggest that RAG-based LLMs can be an excellent support to human customer service representatives by lightening their workload.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-09-05,\n    authors: ['Sriram Veturi', 'Saurabh Vaichal', 'Reshma Lal Jagadheesh', 'Nafis Irtiza Tripto', 'Nian Yan'],\n    score: 94.1415686865115\n},\n{\n    title: DYNAMICQA: Tracing Internal Knowledge Conflicts\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n\nORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>INNOVATION IN AI APPLICATIONS<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-11T00:00:00<|>2024-01-11T00:00:00<|>The paper introduces an end-to-end framework that employs Large Language Models (LLMs) with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) capabilities for industry use cases, which outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms in accuracy and relevance.<|>The paper introduces an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases.\n\nORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT IN AI FIELD<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-05T00:00:00<|>2024-09-05T00:00:00<|>The paper presents an innovative solution that uses RAG-based LLMs to support human customer service representatives by improving their efficiency and effectiveness in handling queries, which outperforms the current BERT-based algorithms.<|>The paper introduces an end-to-end framework that employs LLMs with RAG capabilities for industry use cases.\n\n##\n\nPERSON<|>NONE<|>AUTHORSHIP IN AI RESEARCH<|>TRUE<|>2024-01-11T00:00:00<|>2024-01-11T00:00:00<|>Md.
