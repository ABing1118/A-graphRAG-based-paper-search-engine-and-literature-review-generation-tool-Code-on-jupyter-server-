Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, outdated knowledge and hallucination issues can be major obstacles in their application in knowledge-intensive biomedical scenarios. In this study, we consider the task of biomedical concept recognition (CR) from unstructured scientific literature and explore the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve accuracy and reliability of the LLM-based biomedical CR. Our approach, named REAL (Retrieval Augmented Entity Linking), combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with curated knowledge bases to automatically annotate natural language texts with concepts from bio-ontologies. By applying REAL to benchmark corpora on phenotype concept recognition, we show its effectiveness in improving LLM-based CR performance. This research highlights the potential of combining LLMs with external knowledge sources to advance biomedical text processing.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Workshop on Biomedical Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 3,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": null,\n    \"authors\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
