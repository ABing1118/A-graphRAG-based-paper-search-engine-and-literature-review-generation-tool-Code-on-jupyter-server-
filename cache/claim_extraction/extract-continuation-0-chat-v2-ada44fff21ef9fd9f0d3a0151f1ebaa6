Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

By leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and integrating\ntechnologies such as LangChain and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search), the chatbot processes and indexes large volumes\nof legal documents, delivering precise and contextually relevant insights to user queries. This project addresses the challenge of\nnavigating extensive legal literature by transforming legal PDFs into searchable embeddings stored in FAISS. Users interact\nwith the system through a conversational interface built with Streamlit, which maintains query context to ensure accurate and\naccessible responses for legal professionals and non-specialists alike.The system’s backend infrastructure is implemented in\nPython, utilizing LangChain for efficient language model operations and FAISS for semantic search. Key functionalities\ninclude document ingestion, intelligent retrieval, and conversational interaction. The design prioritizes scalability and\nadaptability, enabling future integrations with diverse legal knowledge bases and supporting additional languages or\njurisdictions.The chatbot’s performance has been validated through extensive testing, showcasing high retrieval precision and\nlow response times. These features significantly enhance productivity by automating time-consuming tasks such as document\nsearch and legal analysis, allowing users to focus on critical decision-making.This project highlights the transformative\npotential of AI in the legal domain, bridging the gap between complex legal information and user accessibility. Future\ndevelopments will aim to enhance the system's natural language processing capabilities, incorporate real-time data updates, and\nintegrate advanced security measures to safeguard sensitive legal information.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been introduced to address this issue by integrating external knowledge, enhancing the factual accuracy of outputs. However, naive RAG encounters challenges in effectively utilizing retrieved content, particularly in specialized domains like biomedicine. LLMs often struggle to integrate retrieved content as irrelevant information can interfere with the model’s judgment. Even if relevant documents are retrieved, the model may be unable to accurately comprehend and utilize the domain-specific features due to its inherent knowledge limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Document Embeddings Enhanced Biomedical RAG (DEEB-RAG), a framework that incorporates document embeddings along with the original retrieved text. DEEB-RAG uses MedCPT to generate document embeddings and these embeddings are then aligned with the LLM’s semantic space using a two-stage training process on a simple projector. Experimental results on biomedical QA datasets show that DEEB-RAG improves accuracy, with an average performance increase of 2.3% over naive RAG. This demonstrates DEEB-RAG’s ability to mitigate the challenges of utilizing complex biomedical information, thereby enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in biomedical domain.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-03,\n    authors: ['Yongle Kong', 'Zhihao Yang', 'Ling Luo',\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CS), 'Jianfeng Zhang'],\nscore: 80\n},\n{\n    title: AI-Powered Legal Querying System using NLP,\n    abstract: The RAG-Based Legal Assistant Chatbot is a cutting-edge AI-powered solution designed to streamline legal information retrieval and document analysis.
