The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

This paper explores the desired qualities of a demonstration retrieval system for ICL. We argue that ICL retrieval in this context resembles item-cold-start recommender systems, prioritizing discovery and maximizing information gain over strict relevance. We propose a novel evaluation method that measures the LLM's subsequent performance on NLP tasks, eliminating the need for subjective diversity scores. Our findings demonstrate the critical role of diversity and quality bias in retrieved demonstrations for effective ICL, and highlight the potential of recommender system techniques in this domain.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-27,\n    authors: ['Emile Contal', 'Garrin McGoldrick'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: LLMs are not Zero-Shot Reasoners for Biomedical Information Extraction,\n    abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for applications in healthcare, reaching the performance of domain experts on tasks such as question answering and document summarisation. Despite their success on these tasks, it is unclear how well LLMs perform on tasks that are traditionally pursued in the biomedical domain, such as structured information extration. To breach this gap, in this paper, we systematically benchmark LLM performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks. We aim to disentangle the contribution of different factors to the performance, particularly the impact of LLMs' task knowledge and reasoning capabilities, their (parametric) domain knowledge, and addition of external knowledge. To this end we evaluate various open LLMs -- including BioMistral and Llama-2 models -- on a diverse set of biomedical datasets, using standard prompting, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Self-Consistency based reasoning as well as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with PubMed\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(ORGANIZATION LLMs<|>NONE<|>BIO-MEDICAL INFORMATION EXTRACTION<|>FALSE<|>2024-05-27T00:00:00<|>2024-05-27T00:00:00<|>The paper systematically benchmarks Large Language Models (LLMs) performance in Medical Classification and Named Entity Recognition tasks, aiming to disentangle the contribution of different factors such as task knowledge, reasoning capabilities, domain knowledge, and external knowledge.
