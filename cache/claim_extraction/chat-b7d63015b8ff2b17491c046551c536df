Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Our retrieval method does not require the external database to have labeled audio, offering more practical use cases. To evaluate our proposed method, we curated test sets in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our empirical results show that the proposed model can effectively leverage the retrieved audio samples and significantly improve zero-shot and few-shot TTA performance, with large margins on multiple evaluation metrics, while maintaining the ability to generate semantically aligned audio for the in-domain setting. In addition, we investigate the effect of different retrieval methods and data sources.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-11-07,\n    authors: ['Mu Yang', 'Bowen Shi', 'Matt Le', 'Wei-Ning Hsu', 'Andros Tjandra'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: A Hybrid Retrieval Approach for Advancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems,\n    abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has become a promising solution for utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) in domain-intensive question-answering tasks. The performance of RAG is greatly influenced by the retriever component, which typically relies on semantic similarity between the text embeddings of the query and the passages to identify the relevant context. However, text embedding models may only capture the semantic meaning of individual passages, potentially neglecting global relationships between them. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid retrieval method that integrates embeddings encoded from textual and knowledge graph information. Although in this paper, the knowledge graphs describe the passage relationships in a health-tech industry use case, the hybrid embedding solution is designed to be generic. Furthermore, the proposed retrieval approach aims to offer straight-forward implementation without requiring complex joint learning processes. Our results on custom test sets demonstrate significantly enhanced accuracy and ranking of the retriever, thus, supporting the LLM-based reader component in generating more accurate responses.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Nguyen Nam Doan', 'Aki Härmä', 'Remzi Celebi', 'Valeria Gottardo'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: SafeRAG: Benchmarking Security in Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Model,\n    abstract: The indexing-retrieval-generation paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been highly successful in solving knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, the incorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability of LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service. Next, we construct RAG security evaluation dataset (i.e., SafeRAG dataset) primarily manually for each task. We then utilize the SafeRAG dataset to simulate various attack scenarios that RAG may encounter. Experiments conducted on 14 representative RAG components demonstrate that RAG exhibits significant vulnerability to all attack tasks and even the most apparent attack task can easily bypass existing retrievers, filters, or advanced LLMs, resulting in the degradation of RAG service quality.

However, attackers may steal those valuable RAGs and deploy or commercialize them, making it essential to detect Intellectual Property (IP) infringement. Most existing ownership protection solutions, such as watermarks, are designed for relational databases and texts. They cannot be directly applied to RAGs because relational database watermarks require white-box access to detect IP infringement, which is unrealistic for the knowledge base in RAGs. Meanwhile, post-processing by the adversary's deployed LLMs typically destructs text watermark information. To address those problems, we propose a novel black-box\"knowledge watermark\"approach, named RAG-WM, to detect IP infringement of RAGs. RAG-WM uses a multi-LLM interaction framework, comprising a Water\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "qwen2:latest", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 2000, "n": 1}, "history": null}
