Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The paper introduces a novel NLP architecture, the Graph-Based Block-to-Block Generation (G3BG), which leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques, the power of attention mechanisms, distributional semantics, graph-based information retrieval, and decentralized networks. The model encodes user prompts to mitigate data breach risk, retrieves relevant information from a graph knowledge base, and forms a block for a conditional language model using LLMs to perform a new secure type of RAG. The model is closed-domain and small-scale oriented. It exhibits superior performance across low-resource NLP tasks, which makes it prominent for industrial use. The research presents a novel graph-based dataset. The dataset comprises private data features to encode and closed-domain textual information for information retrieval. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the G3BG model. The model allows cutting 100x training dataset volume achieving Perplexity ~6.51 on the Language Generation task and F1-Score ~90.3 on the Information Retrieval task comparable to most state-of-the-art language models. The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method and contribute to the algorithmic approaches toward LLM risk mitigation.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-09-30,\n    authors: ['Victoria I.

A typical solution is to employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) coupled with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, which decomposes complex questions into chain-like sub-questions and applies iterative RAG at\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "##\n\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>DATA BREACH PREVENTION<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The model encodes user prompts to mitigate data breach risk, retrieves relevant information from a graph knowledge base, and forms a block for a conditional language model using LLMs to perform a new secure type of RAG.||\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>PLAGIARISM PREVENTION<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The paper introduces a novel NLP architecture, the Graph-Based Block-to-Block Generation (G3BG), which leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to prevent plagiarism.||\n(EVENT<|>NONE<|>INNOVATION IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The paper introduces a novel NLP architecture, the Graph-Based Block-to-Block Generation (G3BG), which leverages state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to improve various natural language processing tasks.||\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>PERPLEXITY REDUCTION<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The model allows cutting 100x training dataset volume achieving Perplexity ~6.51 on the Language Generation task.||\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL EFFICIENCY<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The model achieves F1-Score ~90.3 on the Information Retrieval task comparable to most state-of-the-art language models.||\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>INDUSTRIAL APPLICATION PROMINENCE<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The research presents a novel graph-based dataset that comprises private data features to encode and closed-domain textual information for information retrieval, which is used to train and evaluate the G3BG model.||\n(ORGANIZATION<|>NONE<|>EXPERIMENTAL EFFECTIVENESS PROOF<|>TRUE<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>2024-09-30T00:00:00<|>The experimental results prove the effectiveness of the proposed method and contribute to the algorithmic approaches toward LLM risk mitigation.||\n(PERSON<|>VICTORIA I.
