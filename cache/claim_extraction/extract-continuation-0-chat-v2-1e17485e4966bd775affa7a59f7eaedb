Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Much effort has been dedicated into incorporating pre-trained language models (PLMs) with various open-world knowledge, such as knowledge graphs or wiki pages. However, their ability to access and manipulate the task-specific knowledge is still limited on downstream tasks, as this type of knowledge is usually not well covered in PLMs and is hard to acquire. To address the problem, we propose augmenting TExt Generation via Task-specific and Open-world Knowledge (TegTok) in a unified framework. Our model selects knowledge entries from two types of knowledge sources through dense retrieval and then injects them into the input encoding and output decoding stages respectively on the basis of PLMs. With the help of these two types of knowledge, our model can learn what and how to generate. Experiments on two text generation tasks of dialogue generation and question generation, and on two datasets show that our method achieves better performance than various baseline models.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-03-16,\n    authors: ['Chao-Hong Tan', 'Jia-Chen Gu', 'Chongyang Tao', 'Zhen-Hua Ling', 'Can Xu', 'Huang Hu', 'Xiubo Geng', 'Daxin Jiang'],\n    score: 105.96842909197557\n},\n{\n    title: ActiveRAG: Revealing the Treasures of Knowledge via Active Learning,\n    abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has introduced a new paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), aiding in the resolution of knowledge-intensive tasks. However, current RAG models position LLMs as passive knowledge receptors, thereby restricting their capacity for learning and comprehending ex-ternal knowledge. In this paper, we present A CTIVE RAG, an innovative RAG framework that shifts from passive knowledge acquisition to an active learning mechanism. This approach utilizes the Knowledge Construction mechanism to develop a deeper understanding of external knowledge by associating it with previously acquired or memorized knowledge. Subsequently, it designs the Cognitive Nexus mechanism to incorporate the outcomes from both chains of thought and knowledge construction, thereby calibrating the intrinsic cognition of LLMs. Our experimental results demonstrate that A CTIVE RAG surpasses previous RAG models, achieving a 5% improvement on question-answering datasets.

Although facts themselves are language-agnostic, the fact labels (i.e., language-specific representation of the fact) in the KG are often present only in a few languages. This makes it challenging to link KG facts to sentences in languages other than the limited set of languages. To address this problem, we introduce the task of Multilingual Fact Linking (MFL) where the goal is to link fact expressed in a sentence to corresponding fact in the KG, even when the fact label in the KG is not available in the language of the sentence. To facilitate research in this area, we present a new evaluation dataset, IndicLink. This dataset contains 11,293 linked WikiData facts and 6,429 sentences spanning English and six Indian languages. We propose a Retrieval+Generation model, ReFCoG, that can scale to millions of KG facts by combining Dual Encoder based retrieval with a Seq2Seq based generation model which is constrained to output only valid KG facts. ReFCoG outperforms standard Retrieval+Re-ranking models by 10.7 pts in Precision@1. In spite of this gain, the model achieves an overall score of 52.1, showing ample scope for improvement in the task.ReFCoG code and IndicLink data are available at https://github.com/SaiKeshav/mfl,\n    publicationDate: 2021-09-29,\n    authors: ['Keshav Kolluru', 'Martín Rezk', 'Pat Verga', 'W.

Recent benchmarks designed to assess LLM hallucinations within conventional NLP tasks, such as knowledge-intensive question answering (QA) and\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CoT), have been developed. However, these benchmarks are limited by their reliance on pre-defined templates that may not fully capture the complexity of real-world scenarios where models generate incorrect information without clear cues or contradictions.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose a new evaluation framework called HaluEval-Wild. This framework is designed to evaluate LLM hallucinations in more realistic and complex situations, thereby providing a more comprehensive assessment of model reliability. Our approach involves creating diverse and varied test cases that mimic real-world conditions where models might generate incorrect information.\n\nExperiments on two text generation tasks of dialogue generation and question generation, as well as on two datasets show that our method achieves better performance than various baseline models in detecting hallucinations under these more challenging conditions.\n\nHaluEval-Wild is designed to be adaptable and scalable, allowing researchers and practitioners to continuously update the framework with new test cases and scenarios. This ensures that it remains relevant and effective in evaluating LLMs as they evolve and face new challenges.\n\nThe availability of our dataset and codebase at [GitHub link](https://github.com/your-repo/HaluEval-Wild) enables others to replicate, extend, or adapt the framework for their specific needs, fostering a collaborative environment for advancing the field of language model evaluation."}]}
