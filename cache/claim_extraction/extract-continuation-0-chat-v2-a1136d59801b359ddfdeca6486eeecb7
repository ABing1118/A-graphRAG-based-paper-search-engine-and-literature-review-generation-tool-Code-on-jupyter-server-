Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This paper discusses a retrieval-intensive context of use, whose intended output is the generation of narrative explanations in a non-bona-fide, entertainment mode subject to heavy intertextuality and strictly constrained by culture-bound poetic conventions. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative themes, motifs and tale types. The state of the art in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humour, along with IR and KD, as well as the lessons of the DARSHAN project in a domain closely related to GALLURA’s, make the latter’s goals feasible in principle. 1 CONCEPTUAL & TECHNICAL BACKGROUND In the history of full-text IR, tools for retrieval from very large historical corpora in Hebrew and Aramaic were prominent, with the RESPONSA project (see e.g. Choueka, 1989a\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
