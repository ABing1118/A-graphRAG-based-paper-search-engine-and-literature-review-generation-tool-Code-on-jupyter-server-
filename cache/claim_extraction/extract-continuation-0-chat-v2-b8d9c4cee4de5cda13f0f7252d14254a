Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, RAG accu- racy becomes increasingly challenging as the corpus of docu- ments scales up,with Retrievers playing an outsized role in the overall RAG accuracy by extracting the most relevant document from the corpus to provide context to the LLM. In this paper, we propose different ways to optimize the re- treivals, Reciprocal Rank Fusion, Reranking and dynamic chunking schemes.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-08-31,\n    authors: ['Ashish Bansal'],\n    score: 80\n},\n{\n    title: RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED GENERATION USING DOMAIN-SPECIFIC TEXT: A PILOT STUDY,\n    abstract: The natural language processing (NLP) field has witnessed remarkable advancements with the advent of large language models (LLMs) like GPT, Gemini, Claude, etc. These models are trained on vast amounts of text data, allowing them to generate human-like responses for various tasks. However, despite their impressive capabilities, LLMs have limitations in their ability to incorporate and reason over external knowledge that is not in their training data. This limitation of LLMs is particularly evident in the case of specific domain knowledge. This situation has given rise to the concept of retrieval augmented generation (RAG), an approach that combines the generative power of LLMs with the ability to retrieve and integrate relevant information from external knowledge sources. This research attempts to use RAG as a module in an application designed to answer questions concerning a specific domain, namely social philosophy/philosophy of management, using a published book from the respective domain as an external source. The paper analyzes the mentioned application output, draws conclusions, and traces future directions to improve the accuracy of the output.,\n    publicationDate\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
