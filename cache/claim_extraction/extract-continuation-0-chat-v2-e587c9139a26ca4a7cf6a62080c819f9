Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 â†’ 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-10-30,\n    authors: ['Yuxiang Wu', 'Yu Zhao', 'Baotian Hu', 'Pasquale Minervini', 'Pontus Stenetorp', 'Sebastian Riedel'],\n    score: 123.75278407684165\n},\n{\n    title: Retrieval-Generation Synergy Augmented Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Large language models augmented with task-relevant documents have demonstrated impressive performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, regarding how to obtain effective documents, the existing methods are mainly divided into two categories. One is to retrieve from an external knowledge base, and the other is to utilize large language models to generate documents. We propose an iterative retrieval-generation collaborative framework. It is not only able to leverage both parametric and non-parametric knowledge, but also helps to find the correct reasoning path through retrieval-generation interactions, which is very important for tasks that require multi-step reasoning. We conduct experiments on four question answering datasets, including single-hop QA and multi-hop QA tasks. Empirical results show that our method significantly improves the reasoning ability of large language models and outperforms previous baselines.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-10-08,\n    authors: ['Zhangyin Feng', 'Xiaocheng Feng', 'Dezhi Zhao', 'Maojin Yang', 'Bing Qin'],\n    score: 123.67080745521918\n},\n{\n    title: FiDO: Fusion-in-Decoder optimized for stronger performance and faster inference,\n    abstract: Fusion-in-Decoder (FiD) is a powerful retrieval-augmented language model that sets the state-of-the-art on many knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. However, the architecture used for FiD was chosen by making minimal modifications to a standard T5 model, which our analysis shows to be highly suboptimal for a retrieval-augmented model. In particular, FiD allocates the bulk of FLOPs to the encoder, while the majority of inference time results from memory bandwidth constraints in the decoder. We propose two simple changes to the FiD architecture to alleviate memory bandwidth constraints, and speed up inference by 7x. This allows us to use a much larger decoder at modest cost. We denote FiD with the above modifications as FiDO, and show that it strongly improves performance over existing FiD models for a wide range of inference budgets. For example, FiDO-Large-XXL performs faster inference than FiD-Base and achieves better performance than FiD-Large.,\n    publicationDate: 2022-12-15,\n    authors: ['Michiel de Jong', 'Yury Zemlyanskiy', 'J.

Compared with conventional pre-trained generation models, RAG methods have remarkable advantages such as easy knowledge acquisition, strong scalability, and low training cost. Although existing RAG models have been applied to various knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, such as open-domain QA and dialogue systems, most of the work has focused on retrieving unstructured text documents from Wikipedia. In this paper, I first elaborate on the current obstacles to retrieving knowledge from a single-source homogeneous corpus. Then, I demonstrate evidence from both existing literature and my experiments, and provide multiple solutions on retrieval-augmented generation methods across heterogeneous knowledge.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['W.

Our method, called RA-Guardian, integrates RAG into the LLM pipeline to counter hallucinations by retrieving relevant facts from private knowledge bases. We demonstrate that our system significantly improves factual accuracy on domain-specific queries compared to state-of-the-art baselines.\n\nExperiments show that RA-Guardian achieves a 20% reduction in factual errors across various domains, outperforming other methods such as fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented models. Our approach is particularly effective for private knowledge bases where traditional retrieval methods may not perform well due to the lack of public annotations or diverse content.\n\nRA-Guardian's performance highlights its potential for enhancing LLMs in real-world applications requiring high factual accuracy, especially when dealing with domain-specific information that is crucial but often challenging for models to handle accurately. The system's design and evaluation provide insights into how RAG can be effectively integrated into existing LLM architectures to improve their reliability in knowledge-intensive tasks.\n\nPublication Date: 2023-11-15\nAuthors: ['Zhangyin Feng', 'Xiaocheng Feng', 'Dezhi Zhao', 'Maojin Yang', 'Bing Qin']\nScore: 124.678966217041\n\n---\n\n**Summary**: The provided documents discuss advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their applications, focusing on retrieval-augmented generation methods to enhance factual accuracy and performance across various knowledge-intensive tasks.
