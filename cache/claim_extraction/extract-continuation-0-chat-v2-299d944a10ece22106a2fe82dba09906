DataONE is transdisciplinary, making biological data available from the genome to the ecosystem; making environmental data available from atmospheric, ecological, hydrological, and oceanographic sources; providing secure and long-term preservation and access; and engaging scientists, land-managers, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Curated databases 34 policy makers, students, educators, and the public through logical access and intuitive visualisations. Most importantly, DataONE will serve a broader range of science domains both directly and through the interoperability with the DataONE distributed network. DataONE is a five-year project that began in 2009. I identify key environmental scientific, cyberinfrastructure, and sociocultural challenges and provides a road map for how DataONE is addressing these challenges. Specific examples are based on a DataONE EVA (Exploration, Visualisation and Analysis) Working Group effort to create an integrated database that can be used for better understanding the ecology of bird migrations. The important message is that to succeed in international preservation and access to data we need to recognise the importance of data from the perspective of the scientists to understand the requirements. Scientists want fast access in terms of data and tool discovery, automated/automatic metadata annotation and rapid analysis via appropriate visualisation. They want easy access in terms of data and metadata upload; integrated, linked, and synthesised databases and interoperable and intuitive scientific workflow systems.

The emergence of LLM has introduced innovative methodologies across diverse fields, including the natural sciences. Researchers aim to implement automated, concurrent process driven by LLM to supplant conventional manual, repetitive and labor-intensive work. In the domain of spectral analysis and detection, it is imperative for researchers to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across various research objects, which encompasses the spectroscopic techniques and the chemometric methods that are employed in experiments and analysis. Paradoxically, despite the recognition of spectroscopic detection as an effective analytical method, the fundamental process of knowledge retrieval remains both time-intensive and repetitive. In response to this challenge, we first introduced the Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper(SDAAP) dataset, which is the first open-source textual knowledge dataset for spectral analysis and detection and contains annotated literature data as well as corresponding knowledge instruction data. Subsequently, we also designed an automated Q\\&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset, which can retrieve relevant knowledge and generate high-quality responses by extracting entities in the input as retrieval parameters. It is worth noting that: within this framework, LLM is only used as a tool to provide generalizability, while RAG technique is used to accurately capture the source of the knowledge.This approach not only improves the quality of the generated responses, but also ensures the traceability of the knowledge. Experimental results show that our framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to the baseline.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-21,\n    authors: ['Jiheng Liang', 'Ziru Yu', 'Zujie Xie', 'Xiangyang Yu'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: TongGu: Mastering Classical Chinese Understanding with Knowledge-Grounded Large Language Models,\n    abstract: Classical Chinese is a gateway to the rich heritage and wisdom of ancient China, yet its complexities pose formidable comprehension barriers for most modern people without specialized knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{TongGu} (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge. Third, we present a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding. Extensive experiments across 24 diverse CC\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CCU) tasks demonstrate that TongGu significantly outperforms existing models by up to 13% in accuracy, showcasing its superior performance in understanding and generating Classical Chinese content.\n\nDataONE is a five-year project initiated in 2009 with the aim of addressing key environmental scientific challenges. It seeks to provide secure and long-term preservation and access to biological and environmental data from various sources such as genomics, ecosystems, atmospheric conditions, ecological systems, hydrology, and oceanography.

DataONE aims to serve as an essential resource for international preservation and access to data by fostering a collaborative network that enhances the understanding of complex ecological processes.\n\nThe emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized various fields within natural sciences, enabling automated processes that replace conventional manual tasks which are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Researchers have developed innovative methodologies using LLMs for spectral analysis and detection, aiming to autonomously acquire pertinent knowledge across different research objects related to spectroscopic techniques and chemometric methods employed in experiments and analysis.\n\nTo address the challenge of time-intensive and repetitive knowledge retrieval in spectral analysis and detection, a dataset called SDAAP (Spectral Detection and Analysis Based Paper) was introduced. This open-source textual knowledge dataset contains annotated literature data along with corresponding knowledge instruction data. An automated Q&A framework based on the SDAAP dataset utilizes LLMs for generalizability while incorporating RAG (Retrieval-augmented Generation) techniques to accurately capture the source of knowledge, thereby improving response quality and ensuring traceability.\n\nExperimental results show that this framework generates responses with more reliable expertise compared to baseline models. The TongGu project further advances Classical Chinese Understanding by proposing a CCU-specific Large Language Model underpinned by three core contributions: constructing an instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, implementing Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting while preserving foundational knowledge, and presenting a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding. TongGu significantly outperforms existing models in diverse Classical Chinese tasks, demonstrating its superior performance.\n\nIn summary, DataONE focuses on providing secure data preservation and access across various scientific domains, while the LLM-based Q&A framework and TongGu project address challenges in spectral analysis and classical Chinese understanding respectively, showcasing advancements in cyberinfrastructure and sociocultural challenges through innovative methodologies."}]}
