Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Thus, Draft 1: 17 May 2010 DIR workshop Building a virtual data centre for the biological, ecological and environmental sciences 33 while multiple definitions exist, text mining is typically associated with information retrieval, extraction, and synthesis, with a special stress on gaining new knowledge. Moving beyond information retrieval and extraction, some proportion of published assertions can be repackaged to form synthetic ideas, that is, new compound concepts that are significantly more valuable to the scientific community than the sum of their original assertions. In 1986, researcher Don R. Swanson read a collection of scientific articles that spanned different fields of inquiry. Each of these disconnected communities had information valuable to the other, but due to the lack of crosstalk, did not appear to know it. Swanson noticed, in papers produced by researchers interested in Raynaud’s disease, that its symptoms often included increased blood viscosity and rigidity of erythrocytes. Meanwhile, in the nutrition biology community several publications proposed that dietary fish oil could reduce blood viscosity, without explicitly connecting this finding to Raynaud’s disease. In this early real-world example of synthetic idea generation, Swanson merged these findings to suggest that fish oil can be beneficial for Raynaud’s patients and published his suggestion as a medical hypothesis. The hypothesis was confirmed some years later in an independent randomised clinical trial. Even with current text mining capabilities, such synthetic ideas can be discovered automatically. A more distant but nonetheless realistic aim of the field is to trace and map more sophisticated ideas (idea isomorphisms) that are expressed differently in different scientific fields, yet represent identical problems or their solutions. Were such idea mappings made instantly available through an Internet interface, the result could be truly impressive.
