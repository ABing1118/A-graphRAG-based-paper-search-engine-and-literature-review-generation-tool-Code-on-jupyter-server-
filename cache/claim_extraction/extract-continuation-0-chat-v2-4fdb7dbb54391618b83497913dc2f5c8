Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, there are significant trustworthiness concerns as RALMs are prone to generating unfaithful outputs, including baseless information or contradictions with the retrieved context. This paper proposes SynCheck, a lightweight monitor that leverages fine-grained decoding dynamics including sequence likelihood, uncertainty quantification, context influence, and semantic alignment to synchronously detect unfaithful sentences. By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search for long-form retrieval-augmented generation. Empirical results demonstrate that FOD outperforms traditional strategies such as abstention, reranking, or contrastive decoding significantly in terms of faithfulness, achieving over 10% improvement across six datasets.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-19,\n    authors: ['Di Wu', 'Jia-Chen Gu', 'Fan Yin', 'Nanyun Peng', 'Kai-Wei Chang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: E2E-AFG: An End-to-End Model with Adaptive Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of large language models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model with adaptive filtering for retrieval-augmented generation (E2E-AFG), which integrates answer existence judgment and text generation into a single end-to-end framework. This enables the model to focus more effectively on relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and generating accurate answers.
