Despite decades of research on knowledge graphs and knowledge base question answering, leading LLM frameworks (e.g. Langchain and LlamaIndex) have only minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata. In this paper, we analyze the root cause and suggest that modern RDF knowledge graphs (e.g. Wikidata, Freebase) are less efficient for LLMs due to overly large schemas that far exceed the typical LLM context window, use of resource identifiers, overlapping relation types and lack of normalization. As a solution, we propose property graph views on top of the underlying RDF graph that can be efficiently queried by LLMs using Cypher. We instantiated this idea on Wikidata and introduced CypherBench, the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs with 7.8 million entities and over 10,000 questions. To achieve this, we tackled several key challenges, including developing an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creating a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.\"\n\nOutput:\n\n(organization: GraphRAG system<|>organization: Langchain<|>organization: LlamaIndex<|>TRUE<|>2024-12-24T00:00:00<|>2024-12-24T00:00:00<|>The GraphRAG system, Langchain and LlamaIndex are leading frameworks that have minimal support for retrieval from modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs like Wikidata.<|>The paper discusses the limitations of leading LLM frameworks in relation to modern encyclopedic knowledge graphs such as Wikidata.)\n\n(organization: CypherBench<|>organization: Wikidata<|>event: introduction of benchmark<|>SUSPECTED<|>2024-12-24T00:00:00<|>2024-12-30T00:00:00<|>CypherBench was introduced as the first benchmark with 11 large-scale, multi-domain property graphs on Wikidata.)\n\n(person: Yanlin Feng<|>person: Simone Papicchio<|>person: Sajjadur Rahman<|>TRUE<|>2024-12-24T00:00:00<|>2024-12-30T00:00:00<|>Yanlin Feng, Simone Papicchio and Sajjadur Rahman are authors of the paper discussing the GraphRAG system limitations and proposing solutions.)\n\n(geo: real-world scenarios<|>TRUE<|>2024-12-24T00:00:00<|>2024-12-30T00:00:00<|>Real-world scenarios involve unstructured data obtained from information retrieval systems, which poses a challenge in converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs.)\n\n(event: development of RDF-to-property graph conversion engine<|>event: creation of systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation<|>event: designing new evaluation metrics<|>TRUE<|>2024-12-24T00:00:00<|>2024-12-30T00:00:00<|>The paper discusses the development of key challenges including an RDF-to-property graph conversion engine, creation of a systematic pipeline for text-to-Cypher task generation, and designing new evaluation metrics.)\n\nPlease note that these claims are based on interpreting the provided text according to the entity specification and claim description.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Converting natural language sentences into structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) remains a critical challenge. The quality of constructed KGs may also impact the performance of some KG-dependent domains like GraphRAG systems and recommendation systems.
