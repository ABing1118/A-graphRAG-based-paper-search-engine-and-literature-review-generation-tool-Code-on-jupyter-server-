Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, the untimeliness and cost of knowledge updates coupled with hallucination issues of LLMs have curtailed their applications in knowledge intensive tasks, where retrieval augmented generation (RAG) can be of help. Nevertheless, existing retrieval augmented models typically use similarity as a bridge between queries and documents and follow a retrieve then read procedure. In this work, we argue that similarity is not always the panacea and totally relying on similarity would sometimes degrade the performance of retrieval augmented generation. To this end, we propose MetRag, a Multi layEred Thoughts enhanced Retrieval Augmented Generation framework. To begin with, beyond existing similarity oriented thought, we embrace a small scale utility model that draws supervision from an LLM for utility oriented thought and further come up with a smarter model by comprehensively combining the similarity and utility oriented thoughts. Furthermore, given the fact that the retrieved document set tends to be huge and using them in isolation makes it difficult to capture the commonalities and characteristics among them, we propose to make an LLM as a task adaptive summarizer to endow retrieval augmented generation with compactness-oriented thought. Finally, with multi layered thoughts from the precedent stages, an LLM is called for knowledge augmented generation. Extensive experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks have demonstrated the superiority of MetRag.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 3,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-05-30\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2223763670\",\n        \"name\": \"Chunjing Gan\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2215590272\",\n        \"name\": \"Dan Yang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2279160677\",\n        \"name\": \"Binbin Hu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2257028770\",\n        \"name\": \"Hanxiao Zhang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2258340246\",\n        \"name\": \"Siyuan Li\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2284032340\",\n        \"name\": \"Ziqi Liu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2180240771\",\n        \"name\": \"Yue Shen\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2256994202\",\n        \"name\": \"Lin Ju\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2266809812\",\n        \"name\": \"Zhiqiang Zhang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2283257801\",\n        \"name\": \"Jinjie Gu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2303947668\",\n        \"name\": \"Lei Liang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2272742832\",\n        \"name\": \"Jun Zhou\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 90.79441541679836\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"a546fa44c110c33a3280f31090f96f5b886ac44f\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/a546fa44c110c33a3280f31090f96f5b886ac44f\",\n    \"title\": \"Mindful-RAG: A Study of Points of Failure in Retrieval Augmented Generation\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at generating coherent text but often struggle with knowledge-intensive queries, particularly in domain-specific and factual question-answering tasks. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems have emerged as a promising solution by integrating external knowledge sources, such as structured knowledge graphs (KGs). While KG-based RAG approaches have demonstrated value, current state-of-the-art solutions frequently fall short, failing to deliver accurate and reliable answers even when the necessary factual knowledge is available. In this paper, we present a critical analysis of failure points in existing KG-based RAG methods, identifying eight key areas of concern, including misinterpretation of question context, incorrect relation mapping, and ineffective ambiguity resolution. We argue that these failures primarily stem from design limitations in current KG-RAG systems, such as inadequate attention to discerning user intent and insufficient alignment of retrieved knowledge with the contextual demands of the query. Based on this analysis, we propose a new approach for KG-RAG systems, termed Mindful-RAG, which re-engineers the retrieval process to be more intent-driven and contextually aware.
