Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Recent research has been developed to amplify contextual knowledge over the parametric knowledge of LLMs with contrastive decoding approaches. While these approaches could yield truthful responses when relevant context is provided, they are prone to vulnerabilities when faced with noisy contexts. We extend the scope of previous studies to encompass noisy contexts and propose adaptive contrastive decoding (ACD) to leverage contextual influence effectively. ACD demonstrates improvements in open-domain question answering tasks compared to baselines, especially in robustness by remaining undistracted by noisy contexts in retrieval-augmented generation.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 1,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-08-02\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2189657321\",\n        \"name\": \"Youna Kim\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2166352356\",\n        \"name\": \"Hyuhng Joon Kim\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2284731913\",\n        \"name\": \"Cheonbok Park\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2188345697\",\n        \"name\": \"Choonghyun Park\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2259114784\",\n        \"name\": \"Hyunsoo Cho\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2109166096\",\n        \"name\": \"Junyeob Kim\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"31760501\",\n        \"name\": \"Kang Min Yoo\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2261393515\",\n        \"name\": \"Sang-goo Lee\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"5041757\",\n        \"name\": \"Taeuk Kim\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 80.39720770839918\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"4df2b1e7d54fe5ad81dc2ed6774b93ef7891b3c8\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/4df2b1e7d54fe5ad81dc2ed6774b93ef7891b3c8\",\n    \"title\": \"ARES: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Evaluating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems traditionally relies on hand annotations for input queries, passages to retrieve, and responses to generate. We introduce ARES, an Automated RAG Evaluation System, for evaluating RAG systems along the dimensions of context relevance, answer faithfulness, and answer relevance. By creating its own synthetic training data, ARES finetunes lightweight LM judges to assess the quality of individual RAG components. To mitigate potential prediction errors, ARES utilizes a small set of human-annotated datapoints for prediction-powered inference (PPI). Across eight different knowledge-intensive tasks in KILT, SuperGLUE, and AIS, ARES accurately evaluates RAG systems while using only a few hundred human annotations during evaluation. Furthermore, ARES judges remain effective across domain shifts, proving accurate even after changing the type of queries and/or documents used in the evaluated RAG systems.
