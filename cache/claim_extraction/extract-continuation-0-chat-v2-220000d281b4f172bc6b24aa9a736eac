Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks. Aim. Our empirical study aims to investigate the effectiveness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned LLM in risk analysis. To our knowledge, no prior study has explored its capabilities in risk analysis. Method. We manually curated 193 unique scenarios leading to 1283 representative samples from over 50 mission-critical analyses archived by the industrial context team in the last five years. We compared the base GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models versus their Retrieval-Augmented Generation and fine-tuned counterparts. We employ two human experts as competitors of the models and three other human experts to review the models and the former human experts' analysis. The reviewers analyzed 5,000 scenario analyses. Results and Conclusions. Human experts demonstrated higher accuracy, but LLMs are quicker and more actionable. Moreover, our findings show that RAG-assisted LLMs have the lowest hallucination rates, effectively uncovering hidden risks and complementing human expertise. Thus, the choice of model depends on specific needs, with FTMs for accuracy, RAG for hidden risks discovery, and base models for comprehensiveness and actionability. Therefore, experts can leverage LLMs as an effective complementing companion in risk analysis within a condensed timeframe. They can also save costs by averting unnecessary expenses associated with implementing unwarranted countermeasures.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-11,\n    authors: ['Matteo Esposito', 'Francesco Palagiano', 'Valentina Lenarduzzi'],\n    score: 90.79441541679836\n},\n{\n    title: Knowledge Ply Chat,\n    abstract: Despite their ability to store information and excel at many NLP tasks with fine-tuning, large language models tend to have issues about accurately accessing and altering knowledge, which leads to performance gaps in knowledge-intensive tasks compared to domain-specific architectures. Additionally, these models face problems when it comes to having transparent decision-making processes or updating their world knowledge. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system by improving the Mistral7B model specifically for RAG tasks. The novel training technique includes Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) which enables efficient adaptation of large pre- trained models on-the-fly according to task-specific requirements while reducing computational costs. In addition, this system combines pre-trained embedding models that use pre-trained cross-encoders for effective retrieval and reranking of information. This RAG system will thus leverage these state-of-the-art methodologies towards achieving top performances in a range of NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-04-12,\n    authors: ['M.

This paper discusses a retrieval-intensive context of use, whose intended output is the generation of narrative explanations in a non-bona-fide, entertainment mode subject to heavy intertextuality and strictly constrained by culture-bound poetic conventions. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Combined output for all three articles)\n\nArticle 1:\n- Title: Beyond Words: On Large Language Models Actionability in Mission-Critical Risk Analysis\n- Publication Date: 2024-06-11\n- Authors: Matteo Esposito, Francesco Palagiano, Valentina Lenarduzzi\n- Score: 90.79441541679836\n\nArticle 2:\n- Title: Knowledge Ply Chat\n- Publication Date: 2024-04-12\n- Authors: M.
