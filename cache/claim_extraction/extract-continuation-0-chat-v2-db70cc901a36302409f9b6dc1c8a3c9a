Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

To address this issue, we propose a novel Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework, DuetRAG. Our bootstrapping philosophy is to simultaneously integrate the domain fintuning and RAG models to improve the knowledge retrieval quality, thereby enhancing generation quality. Finally, we demonstrate DuetRAG' s matches with expert human researchers on HotPot QA.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-05-12,\n    authors: ['Dian Jiao', 'Li Cai', 'Jingsheng Huang', 'Wenqiao Zhang', 'Siliang Tang', 'Yueting Zhuang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Evaluating Self-Generated Documents for Enhancing Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Large Language Models,\n    abstract: The integration of documents generated by LLMs themselves (Self-Docs) alongside retrieved documents has emerged as a promising strategy for retrieval-augmented generation systems. However, previous research primarily focuses on optimizing the use of Self-Docs, with their inherent properties remaining underexplored. To bridge this gap, we first investigate the overall effectiveness of Self-Docs, identifying key factors that shape their contribution to RAG performance (RQ1). Building on these insights, we develop a taxonomy grounded in Systemic Functional Linguistics to compare the influence of various Self-Docs categories (RQ2) and explore strategies for combining them with external sources (RQ3). Our findings reveal which types of Self-Docs are most beneficial and offer practical guidelines for leveraging them to achieve significant improvements in knowledge-intensive question answering tasks.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-17,\n    authors: ['Jiatao Li', 'Xinyu Hu', 'Xunjian Yin', 'Xiaojun Wan'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Synchronous Faithfulness Monitoring for Trustworthy Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented language models (RALMs) have shown strong performance and wide applicability in knowledge-intensive tasks. However, there are significant trustworthiness concerns as RALMs are prone to generating unfaithful outputs, including baseless information or contradictions with the retrieved context. This paper proposes SynCheck, a lightweight monitor that leverages fine-grained decoding dynamics including sequence likelihood, uncertainty quantification, context influence, and semantic alignment to synchronously detect unfaithful sentences. By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search for long-form retrieval-augmented generation. Empirical results demonstrate that FOD outperforms traditional strategies such as abstention, reranking, or contrastive decoding significantly in terms of faithfulness, achieving over 10% improvement across six datasets.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-06-19,\n    authors: ['Di Wu', 'Jia-Chen Gu', 'Fan Yin', 'Nanyun Peng', 'Kai-Wei Chang'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: E2E-AFG: An End-to-End Model with Adaptive Filtering for Retrieval-Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation methods often neglect the quality of content retrieved from external knowledge bases, resulting in irrelevant information or potential misinformation that negatively affects the generation results of large language models. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end model with adaptive filtering for retrieval-augmented generation (E2E-AFG), which integrates answer existence judgment and text generation into a single end-to-end framework. This enables the model to focus more effectively on relevant content while reducing the influence of irrelevant information and generating accurate answers. We evaluate E2E-AFG on six representative knowledge-intensive language datasets, and the results show that it consistently outperforms baseline models across all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-11-01,\n    authors: ['Yun Jiang', 'Zilong Xie', 'Wei Zhang', 'Yun Fang', 'Shuai Pan'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Comprehensive and Practical Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation Systems for Medical Question Answering,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in knowledge-intensive tasks such as those from medical domain.
