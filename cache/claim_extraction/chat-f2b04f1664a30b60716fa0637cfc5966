Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4. When finished, output <|COMPLETE|>\n\n-Examples-\nExample 1:\nEntity specification: organization\nClaim description: red flags associated with an entity\nText: According to an article on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.

Humour studies are interdisciplinary. Moreover, GALLURA needs skills from computational linguistics, including some that thus far were modelled by linguistics, but not computationally: folk-etymology (see e.g. Kirwin, 1985; Coates, 1994; Baldinger, 1973; Zuckermann, 2006), and phono-semantic matching (PSM), a discussion of which is found in Zuckermann (2000, 2006). For example, one of several PSM rules as occurring in neologisation by adapting a foreign term (Zuckermann 2000) is as follows (where SL is the source language. TL is the target language): SL y ‘b’ TL(+PSM) x ‘b’ TL x ‘a’ x is phonetically similar to y; a is similar to b That is to say, the PSM introduced a new sense: this was a PSM produced by shifting the meaning of a pre-existent word in the target-language (TL). Another rule of camouflaged borrowing (ibid.) is: SL y ‘b’ TL(+PSM) {x}+{z} ‘b’ TL {x} ‘a’, {z} x is a lexical morpheme (e.g. root) that is phonetically similar to y; z is a grammatical morpheme (e.g. noun-pattern); {x}+{z} is one word; a is similar to b GALLURA should also have quality evaluation capabilities, e.g., evaluating a story generated (Peinado and Gervás, 2006), or evaluating morality within a story (Reeves, 1991). We also need to resort to computational argumentation: some such current research into argumentation in computer science looks into legal narratives (Bex, 2011).
