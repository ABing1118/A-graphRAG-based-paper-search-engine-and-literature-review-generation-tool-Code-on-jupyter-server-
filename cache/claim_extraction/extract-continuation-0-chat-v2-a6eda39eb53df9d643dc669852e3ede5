The text seems to discuss research findings related to generation risks in RAG models and a framework called C-RAG for certifying generation risks. Since there are no clear claims made about entities like organizations, persons, geographies, or events based on this information alone, I will assume that the context might be broad enough to include various entities depending on how they could be related to the topic.\n\nHere's an example of how you might add additional claims:\n\n1. **Organization**: If there are any organizations mentioned in the text document but not included in the previous extraction, you can create a claim like this:\n   ```\n   (ORGANIZATION NAME)<|>(SUBJECT OR OBJECT ENTITY)<|>CLAIM TYPE<|>CLAIM STATUS<|>START DATE<|>END DATE<|>CLAIM DESCRIPTION<|>SOURCE TEXT\n   ```\n\n2. **Person**: If there are any persons mentioned in the text document but not included, you can create a claim like this:\n   ```\n   (PERSON NAME)<|>(SUBJECT OR OBJECT ENTITY)<|>CLAIM TYPE<|>CLAIM STATUS<|>START DATE<|>END DATE<|>CLAIM DESCRIPTION<|>SOURCE TEXT\n   ```\n\n3. **Geo**: If there are any geographical locations mentioned in the text document but not included, you can create a claim like this:\n   ```\n   (GEOGRAPHICAL LOCATION)<|>(SUBJECT OR OBJECT ENTITY)<|>CLAIM TYPE<|>CLAIM STATUS<|>START DATE<|>END DATE<|>CLAIM DESCRIPTION<|>SOURCE TEXT\n   ```\n\n4. **Event**: If there are any events mentioned in the text document but not included, you can create a claim like this:\n   ```\n   (EVENT NAME)<|>(SUBJECT OR OBJECT ENTITY)<|>CLAIM TYPE<|>CLAIM STATUS<|>START DATE<|>END DATE<|>CLAIM DESCRIPTION<|>SOURCE TEXT\n   ```\n\nPlease provide the text document and entity specification details again if you need specific claims for certain entities.", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

We propose C-RAG, the first framework to certify generation risks for RAG models. Specifically, we provide conformal risk analysis for RAG models and certify an upper confidence bound of generation risks, which we refer to as conformal generation risk. We also provide theoretical guarantees on conformal generation risks for general bounded risk functions under test distribution shifts. We prove that RAG achieves a lower conformal generation risk than that of a single LLM when the quality of the retrieval model and transformer is non-trivial. Our intensive empirical results demonstrate the soundness and tightness of our conformal generation risk guarantees across four widely-used NLP datasets on four state-of-the-art retrieval models.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-02-05,\n    authors: ['Mintong Kang', 'Nezihe Merve Gurel', 'Ning Yu', 'D.

LMAs face prevalent issues such as information hallucinations, catastrophic forgetting, and limitations in processing long contexts when dealing with knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper introduces a KG-RAG (Knowledge Graph-Retrieval Augmented Generation) pipeline, a novel framework designed to enhance the knowledge capabilities of LMAs by integrating structured Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with the functionalities of LLMs, thereby significantly reducing the reliance on the latent knowledge of LLMs. The KG-RAG pipeline constructs a KG from unstructured text and then performs information retrieval over\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
