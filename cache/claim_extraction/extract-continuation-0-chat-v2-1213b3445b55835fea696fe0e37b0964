Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

This paper proposes SynCheck, a lightweight monitor that leverages fine-grained decoding dynamics including sequence likelihood, uncertainty quantification, context influence, and semantic alignment to synchronously detect unfaithful sentences. By integrating efficiently measurable and complementary signals, SynCheck enables accurate and immediate feedback and intervention. Experiments show that SynCheck significantly outperforms existing faithfulness detection baselines, achieving over 0.85 AUROC across a suite of six long-form retrieval-augmented generation tasks. Leveraging SynCheck, we further introduce FOD, a faithfulness-oriented decoding algorithm guided by beam search for long-form retrieval-augmented generation. Empirical results demonstrate that FOD outperforms traditional strategies such as abstention, reranking, or contrastive decoding significantly in terms of faithfulness, achieving over 10% improvement across six datasets.\",\n    \"venue\": \"Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-06-19\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2107535909\",\n        \"name\": \"Di Wu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2308241925\",\n        \"name\": \"Jia-Chen Gu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2281946748\",\n        \"name\": \"Fan Yin\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2256996328\",\n        \"name\": \"Nanyun Peng\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2257127887\",\n        \"name\": \"Kai-Wei Chang\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"52008bf2a58054e38a7b630dcf021e1c9bf8d109\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/52008bf2a58054e38a7b630dcf021e1c9bf8d109\",\n    \"title\": \"Adapting Large Language Models for Biomedicine though Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Documents Scoring\",\n    \"abstract\": \"By integrating the generative capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with external biomedical knowledge repositories, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers significant potential for addressing knowledge-intensive biomedical tasks, enhancing the precision and effectiveness of clinical decision-making.
