Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

We also need to resort to computational argumentation: some such current research into argumentation in computer science looks into legal narratives (Bex, 2011). Explanation as sought in GALLURA need not necessarily be realistic; it is non-bona-fide (like in humour), and must conform to a set of conventions, of which realism is just a particular case (cf. Nissan, 2008). There are constraints on style: the output text generated conforms to the early rabbinic linguistic stratum and style (thus emulating the aggadic midrash), with constraints on which lexical items or morphological forms can be selected. Rabbinic stylemes are the subject of current IR research, including in the CUISINE text classifier. So are the identification of rabbinic citations, and chronological classification based on them. In fact, HaCohen-Kerner et al. (2010a) discussed stylistic feature sets for classification in CUISINE. Automated identification of citations from rabbinic texts has been researched (HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2010c).

However, existing RAG framework either indiscriminately perform retrieval or rely on rigid single-class classifiers to select retrieval methods, leading to inefficiencies and suboptimal performance across queries of varying complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy based on query complexity. % our solution Our approach leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm, which treats each retrieval method as a distinct ``arm'' and adapts the selection process by balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, we introduce a dynamic reward function that balances accuracy and efficiency, penalizing methods that require more retrieval steps, even if they lead to a correct result.

Recently, Attributed Text Generation (ATG) has attracted growing attention, which provides citations to support the model's responses in R\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CS). However, ATG often fails to ground every sentence due to its reliance on a single retrieval strategy and limited context-awareness.\n\nTo address this issue, we propose Ground Every Sentence (GES), an innovative method that integrates reference-claim generation with interleaved citations. GES dynamically selects the most suitable retrieval strategy for each sentence based on its complexity, ensuring comprehensive grounding of every sentence in the generated text. This approach not only improves the coherence and accuracy of RAG systems but also enhances their ability to handle complex knowledge-intensive tasks.\n\nOur method introduces a reinforcement learning-based framework that leverages a multi-armed bandit algorithm to adaptively choose between different retrieval methods for each sentence, balancing exploration and exploitation. Additionally, GES incorporates a dynamic reward function that prioritizes both accuracy and efficiency, penalizing retrieval strategies that require more steps but still deliver correct results.\n\nGES achieves new state-of-the-art performance on multiple single-hop and multi-hop datasets while significantly reducing retrieval costs compared to existing RAG methods. The reduction in retrieval costs is achieved by optimizing the selection of retrieval strategies based on sentence complexity, leading to a more efficient use of resources during generation.\n\nThe code for our method is available at <https://github.com/FUTUREEEEEE/GroundEverySentence>. GES represents a significant advancement in the field of RAG, offering a scalable and context-aware solution that addresses key limitations in current retrieval-augmented language models. This method not only improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks but also enhances their ability to handle complex scenarios by grounding every sentence with relevant citations.\n\nIn summary, Ground Every Sentence (GES) is an innovative approach that integrates reference-claim generation and interleaved citation selection in RAG systems. By dynamically adapting retrieval strategies based on sentence complexity and optimizing the balance between accuracy and efficiency, GES significantly improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks while reducing retrieval costs.
