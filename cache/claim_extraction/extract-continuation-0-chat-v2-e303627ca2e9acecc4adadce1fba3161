{"result": "Title: \"Enhancing Speech Recognition through Multi-Modal Fusion\"\nAbstract: \"We introduce a novel multi-modal fusion technique that integrates visual and acoustic information to improve speech recognition accuracy. Our method achieves an average improvement of 15% in word error rate (WER) over state-of-the-art single-modal systems. Furthermore, the proposed approach demonstrates robustness against noisy environments, with a reduction in WER by 20% under high noise conditions compared to traditional acoustic models.\"\n\n**Output:**\n{\n  \"claims\": [\n    {\n      \"text\": \"A new multi-modal fusion technique enhances speech recognition by reducing the word error rate (WER) by 15%.\",\n      \"type\": \"Experimental Result\",\n      \"supporting_evidence\": \"Evaluation on various speech datasets.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The integration of visual and acoustic information leads to superior performance in speech recognition tasks compared to single-modal approaches.\",\n      \"type\": \"Theoretical Insight\",\n      \"supporting_evidence\": \"Comparison with state-of-the-art systems using quantitative metrics like WER.\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"text\": \"The proposed method shows robustness against noisy environments, decreasing the word error rate (WER) by 20% compared to traditional acoustic models under high noise conditions.\",\n      \"type\": \"Experimental Result\",\n      \"supporting_evidence\": \"Evaluation in noisy environment simulations.\"\n    }\n  ]\n}", "input": "MANY entities were missed in the last extraction.
