These methods often involve the labour intensive and expensive creation of training labels for each resource. In contrast, LLMs have exhibited strong effectiveness as zero-shot methods across NLP and IR tasks. We hypothesise that in the context of federated search LLMs can assess the relevance of resources without the need for extensive predefined labels or features. In this paper, we propose ReSLLM. Our ReSLLM method exploits LLMs to drive the selection of resources in federated search in a zero-shot setting. In addition, we devise an unsupervised fine tuning protocol, the Synthetic Label Augmentation Tuning (SLAT), where the relevance of previously logged queries and snippets from resources is predicted using an off-the-shelf LLM and then in turn used to fine-tune ReSLLM with respect to resource selection. Our empirical evaluation and analysis details the factors influencing the effectiveness of LLMs in this context. The results showcase the merits of ReSLLM for resource selection: not only competitive effectiveness in the zero-shot setting, but also obtaining large when fine-tuned using SLAT-protocol.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-01-31,\n    authors: ['Shuai Wang', 'Shengyao Zhuang', 'B.

Risk analysis assesses potential risks in specific scenarios. Risk analysis principles are context-less; the same methodology can be applied to a risk connected to health and information technology security. Risk analysis requires a vast knowledge of national and international regulations and standards and is time and effort-intensive. A large language model can quickly summarize information in less time than a human and can be fine-tuned to specific tasks.
