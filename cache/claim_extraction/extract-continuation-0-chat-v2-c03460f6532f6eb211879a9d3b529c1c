Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37-120%, 8-39%, and 80-290% relative gains against the vanilla LM (GPT-3.5), a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively.

RAG expands the query context by incorporating external knowledge bases to enhance the response accuracy. However, it would be inefficient to access LLMs multiple times for each query and unreliable to retrieve all the relevant documents by a single query. We have found that even though there is low relevance between some critical documents and query, it is possible to retrieve the remaining documents by combining parts of the documents with the query. To mine the relevance, a two-stage retrieval framework called Dynamic-Relevant Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DR-RAG) is proposed to improve document retrieval recall and the accuracy of answers while maintaining efficiency. Additionally, a compact classifier is applied to two different selection strategies to determine the contribution of the retrieved documents to answering the query and retrieve the relatively relevant documents. Meanwhile, DR-RAG call the LLMs only once, which significantly improves the efficiency of the experiment. The experimental results on multi-hop QA datasets show that DR-RAG can significantly improve the accuracy of the answers and achieve new progress in QA systems.\",\n    \"venue\": \"arXiv.org\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 3,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-06-11\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305682244\",\n        \"name\": \"Zijian Hei\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305742427\",\n        \"name\": \"Weiling Liu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"46223131\",\n        \"name\": \"Wenjie Ou\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305681770\",\n        \"name\": \"Juyi Qiao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305663892\",\n        \"name\": \"Junming Jiao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2305665203\",\n        \"name\": \"Guowen Song\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2306947084\",\n        \"name\": \"Ting Tian\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2306954967\",\n        \"name\": \"Yi Lin\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 90.79441541679836\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"915539c51252649cf7d09e25dea3af199235ebed\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/915539c51252649cf7d09e25dea3af199235ebed\",\n    \"title\": \"Adaptive Contrastive Decoding in Retrieval-Augmented Generation for\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Omitting the paper metadata and focusing on the abstracts and titles):\n\n1. **DR-RAG: Applying Dynamic Document Relevance to Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Question-Answering**\n   - **Abstract**: \n     - Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has shown promising performance in knowledge-intensive tasks like Question-Answering (QA).
