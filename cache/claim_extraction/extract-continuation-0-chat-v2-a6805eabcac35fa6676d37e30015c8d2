Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

To overcome these limitations, we propose Document Embeddings Enhanced Biomedical RAG (DEEB-RAG), a framework that incorporates document embeddings along with the original retrieved text. DEEB-RAG uses MedCPT to generate document embeddings and these embeddings are then aligned with the LLM’s semantic space using a two-stage training process on a simple projector. Experimental results on biomedical QA datasets show that DEEB-RAG improves accuracy, with an average performance increase of 2.3% over naive RAG. This demonstrates DEEB-RAG’s ability to mitigate the challenges of utilizing complex biomedical information, thereby enhancing the reliability and effectiveness of LLMs in biomedical domain.\",\n    \"venue\": \"IEEE International Conference on Bioinformatics and Biomedicine\",\n    \"year\": 2024,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": [\n      \"JournalArticle\",\n      \"Conference\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2024-12-03\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2330558113\",\n        \"name\": \"Yongle Kong\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"151472911\",\n        \"name\": \"Zhihao Yang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"145965453\",\n        \"name\": \"Ling Luo\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"12130245\",\n        \"name\": \"Zeyuan Ding\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"145131943\",\n        \"name\": \"Lei Wang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2279996835\",\n        \"name\": \"Wei Liu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2108505046\",\n        \"name\": \"Yin Zhang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2279974261\",\n        \"name\": \"Bo Xu\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"49605993\",\n        \"name\": \"Jian Wang\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2143552718\",\n        \"name\": \"Yuanyuan Sun\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"3009486\",\n        \"name\": \"Zhehuan Zhao\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2278407005\",\n        \"name\": \"Hongfei Lin\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 76\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"80b516bdcb598009a06bbf364055f58f87c442b6\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/80b516bdcb598009a06bbf364055f58f87c442b6\",\n    \"title\": \"Experiments with Large Language Models on Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Closed-Source Simulation Software\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly helpful in text generation, even writing code in programming languages based on user prompts written in natural language. They are even applied to generate simulation models for multibody systems from natural language. Research results suggest that LLMs surpass the mere replication of existing code examples, where some LLMs have been trained on an open-source multibody simulation code. However, for closed-source simulation software, such results are not to be expected as their ideas and concepts might differ from other publicly available ones. LLMs can hallucinate for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as model creation, which can lead to wrong responses. This is especially the case for the LLM unknown closed-source simulation software. The same applies to other internal knowledge kept private to protect intellectual property or data privacy. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach might yield a solution for these knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper explores the application of RAG to closed-source simulation software and presents first experiments. After a brief introduction to LLMs, the RAG approach, and the simulation method applied by the close-source simulation software, several examples are provided to test LLMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems. The examples show promising results indicating the benefits of applying RAG systems to closed-source simulation software, helping to access their knowledge. Nevertheless, they also reveal gaps in the applied information and open questions for further research.\",\n    \"venue\": \"\",\n    \"year\": 2025,\n    \"citationCount\": 0,\n    \"openAccessPdf\": null,\n    \"fieldsOfStudy\": [\n      \"Computer Science\"\n    ],\n    \"publicationTypes\": null,\n    \"publicationDate\": \"2025-02-06\",\n    \"authors\": [\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2274761775\",\n        \"name\": \"Andreas Baumann\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"authorId\": \"2344091628\",\n        \"name\": \"Peter Eberhard\"\n      }\n    ],\n    \"source\": \"semantic_scholar\",\n    \"score\": 70\n  },\n  {\n    \"paperId\": \"c311a89de3f869ec97973ad68c7a267cbfd23971\",\n    \"url\": \"https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/c311a89de3f869ec97973ad68c7a267cbfd23971\",\n    \"title\": \"DuetRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation\",\n    \"abstract\": \"Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods augment the input of Large Language Models\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CLLMs) with retrieved information to improve their performance on knowledge-intensive tasks. However, most existing RAG systems are designed for open-source code and data, which limits their applicability in scenarios where private or confidential information is involved. This paper introduces DuetRAG, a novel collaborative retrieval-augmented generation framework specifically tailored for closed-source simulation software.\n\nDuetRAG aims to address the challenges of knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating two key components: an external knowledge base and an internal knowledge source within the simulation software. The external knowledge base consists of publicly available resources such as documentation, forums, and other online platforms that provide insights into similar systems or related technologies. Meanwhile, the internal knowledge source captures the specific functionalities, algorithms, and data structures unique to the closed-source software.\n\nThe collaborative aspect of DuetRAG involves a bidirectional information exchange between these two components during the generation process. The external knowledge base helps CLLMs fill in gaps where they lack domain-specific knowledge or have misconceptions about certain aspects of the simulation software. Conversely, the internal knowledge source ensures that the generated output remains consistent with the actual behavior and requirements of the closed-source system.\n\nBy leveraging this collaborative framework, DuetRAG enhances the performance of CLLMs on tasks such as model creation, code generation, and simulation scenarios for closed-source simulation software. This approach not only improves the accuracy and reliability of the generated content but also respects intellectual property rights by avoiding direct access to sensitive or proprietary information.\n\nThe paper presents several examples demonstrating the effectiveness of DuetRAG in various applications related to closed-source simulation software. These experiments showcase how the integration of external knowledge with internal system-specific insights leads to more informed, accurate, and contextually relevant outputs compared to traditional CLLMs without RAG augmentation.\n\nIn conclusion, DuetRAG represents a significant advancement in the field of retrieval-augmented generation by addressing the limitations of existing systems when dealing with closed-source software. This collaborative framework opens up new possibilities for leveraging large language models in scenarios where access to private or confidential information is necessary but cannot be directly utilized due to privacy concerns or intellectual property restrictions.\n\n- DuetRAG: Collaborative Retrieval-Augmented Generation"}]}
