Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Recently, RAG-end2end model further optimized the architecture and achieved notable performance improvements on domain adaptation. However, the effectiveness of these RAG-based architectures remains relatively unexplored when fine-tuned on specialized domains such as customer service for building a reliable conversational AI system. Furthermore, a critical challenge persists in reducing the occurrence of hallucinations while maintaining high domain-specific accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the performance of diverse RAG and RAG-like architectures through domain adaptation and evaluated their ability to generate accurate and relevant response grounded in the contextual knowledge base. To facilitate the evaluation of the models, we constructed a novel dataset HotelConvQA, sourced from wide range of hotel-related conversations and fine-tuned all the models on our domain specific dataset. We also addressed a critical research gap on determining the impact of domain adaptation on reducing hallucinations across different RAG architectures, an aspect that was not properly measured in prior work. Our evaluation shows positive results in all metrics by employing domain adaptation, demonstrating strong performance on QA tasks and providing insights into their efficacy in reducing hallucinations. Our findings clearly indicate that domain adaptation not only enhances the models' performance on QA tasks but also significantly reduces hallucination across all evaluated RAG architectures.,\n    publicationDate: 2024\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
