The most closely studied model is a large textual corpus of playfully creative writing that embodies midrashic literary devices, by explaining fancifully place-names of names for animal kinds. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, requires, among the other things, capabilities of story-generation, and of generating a playful explanation. By themselves, these two tasks draw upon three areas in AI: explanation synthesis (for which, see e.g. Schank, 1986, 1994; Walton, 2004), story-generation (see e.g. Liu and Singh, 2002; Lönneker et al., 2005; and a long survey in Nissan, 2011a: Ch. 5), and computational humour (see e.g. Stock et al., 2002; Ritchie, 2004; Waller et al., 2009). Humour studies are interdisciplinary. Moreover, GALLURA needs skills from computational linguistics, including some that thus far were modelled by linguistics, but not computationally: folk-etymology (see e.g. Kirwin, 1985; Coates, 1994; Baldinger, 1973; Zuckermann, 2006), and phono-semantic matching (PSM), a discussion of which is found in Zuckermann (2000, 200\n```\n\nUpon re-examination:\n\n**Organization:**\n- HAHA project\n- GALLURA project\n\n**Person:**\n- Stock\n- Strapparava\n- Valitutti\n- Schank\n- Liu and Singh\n- Lönneker et al.\n- Nissan\n- Zuckermann\n- Kirwin\n- Coates\n- Baldinger\n\n**Geo:**\n- GALLURA (specific geographical location mentioned in the context of the project)\n\n**Event:**\n- The development phase of the GALLURA project\n- The publication years associated with Stock and Strapparava, Strapparava and Valitutti, Schank, Liu and Singh, Lönneker et al., Nissan, Zuckermann, Kirwin, Coates, Baldinger\n\n**Additional Entities:**\n- 2 FUNCTIONS IN GALLURA (specific functions related to the project)\n\nPlease note that while this extraction is based on a thorough reading of the text, it might not be exhaustive due to the complexity and length of the document.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.
