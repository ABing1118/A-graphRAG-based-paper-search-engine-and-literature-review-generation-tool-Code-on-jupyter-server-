This paper discusses a retrieval-intensive scenario where the intended output is generating narrative explanations, particularly for entertainment purposes that involve heavy intertextuality and strict cultural poetic conventions. The Gallura project, currently in design phase, employs a multiagent architecture with modules requiring IR to solve specialist subtasks.\n\n- Context: Historically, tools like RESPONSA were pivotal in full-text IR, especially when dealing with large historical corpora in Hebrew and Aramaic (Choueka, 1989a; Choueka et al., 1971). Before the advent of web search engines, these tools significantly impacted society by enabling the retrieval of legal precedents in rabbinic jurisprudence, particularly affecting Israeli family law.\n\n- Cultural and Religious Context: Religious cultures have been significant consumers of religious texts, driving early projects in IR. Examples include Padre Busa’s Index Thomisticus in Milan and humanities computing at the Abbey of Maredsous in Belgium. Exegesis involves layers of texts where secondary texts refer to primary texts or expand on biblical narratives.\n\n- Tools: HyperJoseph is a hypertextual tool that elaborates on the story of Joseph in Genesis, while DARSHAN is a Hebrew homily invention tool (HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2007). Both tools extensively use networks of lexical concepts and generate ranked sets of homilies.\n\n- Conclusion: The Gallura project aims to leverage IR capabilities along with mining within large textual corpora, databases of narrative themes, motifs, and tale types. With advancements in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humor, and IR/KD, the Gallura project's goals are feasible theoretically.\n\n- References:\n1. Choueka, Y. (1989a).

These tools are designed to generate homilies or explanations based on biblical texts, using extensive networks of lexical concepts.\n\n- Context: Historically, projects such as RESPONSA have played a significant role in information retrieval from large historical corpora in Hebrew and Aramaic (Choueka et al., 1971; Choueka et al., 1987). These tools were pivotal before the rise of web search engines.\n\n- Cultural and Religious Context: The consumption of religious texts by cultural and religious communities has driven early projects in information retrieval. Tools like HyperJoseph provide a hypertextual exploration of biblical narratives, while DARSHAN generates Hebrew homilies using intensive retrieval techniques.\n\n- Conclusion: With advancements in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humor, and IR/KD, the Gallura project aims to leverage these capabilities for narrative generation tasks that involve intertextuality and cultural constraints. The feasibility of such projects is supported by theoretical frameworks and historical precedents set by tools like RESPONSA.\n\n- References:\n1. Choueka et al., 1971.\n2. Choueka et al., 1987.\n3.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

This paper discusses a retrieval-intensive context of use, whose intended output is the generation of narrative explanations in a non-bona-fide, entertainment mode subject to heavy intertextuality and strictly constrained by culture-bound poetic conventions. The GALLURA project, now in the design phase, has a multiagent architecture whose modules thoroughly require IR in order to solve specialist subtasks. By their very nature, such subtasks are best subserved by efficient IR as well as mining capabilities within large textual corpora, or networks of signifiers and lexical concepts, as well as databases of narrative themes, motifs and tale types. The state of the art in AI, NLP, story-generation, computational humour, along with IR and KD, as well as the lessons of the DARSHAN project in a domain closely related to GALLURA’s, make the latter’s goals feasible in principle. 1 CONCEPTUAL & TECHNICAL BACKGROUND In the history of full-text IR, tools for retrieval from very large historical corpora in Hebrew and Aramaic were prominent, with the RESPONSA project (see e.g. Choueka, 1989a, 1989b; Choueka et al. 1971, 1987). Before the rise of Web search engines, RESPONSA tools were the ones which achieved the more far-reaching effects on society, because how they empowered the retrieval of legal precedents in rabbinic jurisprudence, thus affecting especially legal practice of family law in Israel (as for family law, in the Ottoman successor states, the usual jurisdiction is the courts of the various religious communities). Religious cultures, as being the “consumers” of religious texts, were, in a sense, the customers of a considerable portion of early projects in IR: apart from RESPONSA, whose corpora comprise the Jewish texts from the sacred sphere through the ages, this was also the case of Padre Busa’s Index Thomisticus in Milan, and of the humanities computing at the Abbey of Maredsous, in Belgium. Exegesis (such as biblical interpretations) and homiletics involve layers of texts, where a secondary text refers to and either just quotes, or discusses, some locus in the primary text; or then (as in the Jewish aggadic midrash) expands on a biblical narratives, filling the gaps where the primary text is silent. Collections of aggadic midrash from late antiquity (e.g., the Midrash Rabbah) or the Middle Ages (e.g., Yalqut Shim‘oni) are a digest of a multitude of homilies on biblical fragments of texts, developing several often alternative ideas and subnarratives. Cf. Hirshman (2006), Braude (1982), Fishbane (1993), Hartman and Budick (1986). * HyperJoseph is a hypertextual tool on the story of Joseph in Genesis, with the secondary texts elaborating on it (Nissan and Weiss, 1994). * DARSHAN is a tool that invents homilies in Hebrew (HaCohen-Kerner et al. 2007). Retrieval in DARSHAN is intensive, and so is the use of networks of lexical concepts. DARSHAN generates ranked sets of either onesentence or one-paragraph homilies. While producing its output, DARSHAN is able to quote 487 Nissan E. and HaCohen-Kerner Y.. INFORMATION RETRIEVAL IN THE SERVICE OF GENERATING NARRATIVE EXPLANATION What we Want from GALLURA.
