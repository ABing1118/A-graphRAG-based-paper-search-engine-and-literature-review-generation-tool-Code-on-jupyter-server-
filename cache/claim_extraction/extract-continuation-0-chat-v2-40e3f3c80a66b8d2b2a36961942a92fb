Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

One the one hand, LLMs sometimes struggle to generate reliable answers based on the black-box parametric knowledge, due to the lack of responsible knowledge. Moreover, fragmented knowledge facts extracted by knowledge retrievers fail to provide explicit and coherent reasoning paths for improving LLM reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-CoT, a novel knowledge-augmented paradigm that leverages a small-scale step-by-step graph reasoning model to reason over knowledge graphs (KGs) and utilizes a reasoning path generation method to generate chains of reasoning with high confidence for large-scale LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our KG-CoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive question answering tasks, such as multi-hop, single-hop, and open-domain question answering benchmarks, without fine-tuning LLMs. KG-CoT outperforms the CoT prompting as well as prior retrieval-augmented and knowledge base question answering baselines. Moreover, KG-CoT can reduce the number of API calls and cost and generalize to various LLM backbones in a lightweight plug-and-play manner.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-01,\n    authors: ['Ruilin Zhao', 'Feng Zhao', 'Long Wang', 'Xianzhi Wang', 'Guandong Xu'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: MRAG: A Modular Retrieval Framework for Time-Sensitive Question Answering,\n    abstract: Understanding temporal relations and answering time-sensitive questions is crucial yet a challenging task for question-answering systems powered by large language models (LLMs).
