Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, the compute costs of inferencing long-context LLMs are massive and often prohibitive in practice. RAG offers an efficient and effective alternative: retrieve and process only the subset of the context most important for the current task. Although promising, recent work applying RAG to long-context tasks has two core limitations: 1) there has been little focus on making the RAG pipeline compute efficient, and 2) such works only test on simple QA tasks, and their performance on more challenging tasks is unclear. To address this, we develop an algorithm based on PageRank, a graph-based retrieval algorithm, which we call mixture-of-PageRanks (MixPR). MixPR uses a mixture of PageRank-based graph-retrieval algorithms implemented using sparse matrices for efficent, cheap retrieval that can deal with a variety of complex tasks. Our MixPR retriever achieves state-of-the-art results across a wide range of long-context benchmark tasks, outperforming both existing RAG methods, specialized retrieval architectures, and long-context LLMs despite being far more compute efficient. Due to using sparse embeddings, our retriever is extremely compute efficient, capable of embedding and retrieving millions of tokens within a few seconds and runs entirely on CPU.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-08,\n    authors: ['Nick Alonso', 'Beren Millidge'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: GraphRAG under Fire,\n    abstract: GraphRAG advances retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by structuring external knowledge as multi-scale knowledge graphs, enabling language models to integrate both broad context and granular details in their reasoning\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
