Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors such as contextual ignorance and contextual overinclusion. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy, dubbed KnowPO, aimed at achieving adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we proposed a general paradigm for constructing knowledge conflict datasets, which comprehensively cover various error types and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, we proposed a rewriting strategy and data ratio optimization strategy to address preference imbalances\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(GENEREAG<|>GPT-3.5 AND GPT-4<|>PERFORMANCE COMPARISON<|>TRUE<|>2024-06-28T00:00:00<|>2024-06-28T00:00:00<|>GeneRAG outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, with a 39% improvement in answering gene questions, a 43% performance increase in cell type annotation, and a 0.25 decrease in error rates for gene interaction prediction according to the publication on June 28th, 2024<|>According to the publication on June 28th, 2024, GeneRAG outperforms GPT-3.5 and GPT-4)\n\n(KNOWPO: KNOWLEDGE-AWARE PREFERENCE OPTIMIZATION FOR CONTROLLABLE KNOWLEDGE SELECTION IN RETRIEVAL-AUGMENTED LANGUAGE MODELS<|>NONE<|>KNOWLEDGE OPTIMIZATION AND CONFLICT RESOLUTION<|>TRUE<|>2024-06-28T00:00:00<|>2024-06-28T00:00:00<|>KnowPO strategy aims to achieve adaptive knowledge selection based on contextual relevance in real retrieval scenarios according to the publication on June 28th, 2024<|>According to the publication on June 28th, 2024, KnowPO is proposed as a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization strategy)\n\n<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
