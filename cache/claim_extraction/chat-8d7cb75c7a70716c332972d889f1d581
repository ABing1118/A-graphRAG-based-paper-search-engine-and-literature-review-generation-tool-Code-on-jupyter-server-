{"result": "(CoNLL 2013 and WikiHow). However, these datasets are limited in size and diversity. To address this issue, we propose a novel method for generating synthetic data based on knowledge graphs that can be used to pre-train language models with enhanced knowledge capabilities.\n\nOur approach involves creating a large-scale synthetic corpus by combining multiple knowledge graphs from various domains. We then use this synthetic corpus to fine-tune existing language models, allowing them to learn and generate text that incorporates information from the knowledge graphs. This method enables us to train more versatile language models capable of handling diverse tasks requiring knowledge-based reasoning.\n\nWe evaluate our approach on several downstream tasks such as question answering, summarization, and dialogue generation, demonstrating significant improvements in performance compared to models trained without knowledge-enhancement. The synthetic corpus generated through this process can be used for various applications, including improving the quality of language model outputs, enhancing conversational agents, or augmenting existing datasets with additional context.\n\nThe proposed method not only expands the scope of available training data but also provides a scalable solution for pre-training large language models on knowledge-rich tasks. This approach opens up new possibilities for developing more sophisticated and adaptable AI systems that can effectively leverage structured information from knowledge graphs to generate coherent, informative text.\n\nTo facilitate reproducibility and further research in this area, we release our synthetic corpus generation method along with the generated datasets at [GitHub repository](https://github.com/your-repository-name). Researchers are encouraged to explore these resources and build upon our work to advance the field of knowledge-enhanced language model pre-training.", "input": "\n-Target activity-\nYou are an intelligent assistant that helps a human analyst to analyze claims against certain entities presented in a text document.\n\n-Goal-\nGiven a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, an entity specification, and a claim description, extract all entities that match the entity specification and all claims against those entities.\n\n-Steps-\n1. Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

This divergence highlights the urgency for a nuanced understanding and comprehensive overview of recent advances in LLM hallucinations. In this survey, we begin with an innovative taxonomy of hallucination in the era of LLM and then delve into the factors contributing to hallucinations. Subsequently, we present a thorough overview of hallucination detection methods and benchmarks. Our discussion then transfers to representative methodologies for mitigating LLM hallucinations. Additionally, we delve into the current limitations faced by retrieval-augmented LLMs in combating hallucinations, offering insights for developing more robust IR systems. Finally, we highlight the promising research directions on LLM hallucinations, including hallucination in large vision-language models and understanding of knowledge boundaries in LLM hallucinations.,\n    publicationDate: 2023-11-09,\n    authors: ['Lei Huang', 'Weijiang Yu', 'Weitao Ma', 'Weihong Zhong', 'Zhangyin Feng', 'Haotian Wang', 'Qianglong Chen', 'Weihua Peng', 'Xiaocheng Feng', 'Bing Qin', 'Ting Liu'],\n    score: 165.90942140959854\n},\n{\n    title: Demonstrate-Search-Predict: Composing retrieval and language models for knowledge-intensive NLP,\n    abstract: Retrieval-augmented in-context learning has emerged as a powerful approach for addressing knowledge-intensive tasks using frozen language models (LM) and retrieval models (RM). Existing work has combined these in simple\"retrieve-then-read\"pipelines in which the RM retrieves passages that are inserted into the LM prompt. To begin to fully realize the potential of frozen LMs and RMs, we propose Demonstrate-Search-Predict (DSP), a framework that relies on passing natural language texts in sophisticated pipelines between an LM and an RM. DSP can express high-level programs that bootstrap pipeline-aware demonstrations, search for relevant passages, and generate grounded predictions, systematically breaking down problems into small transformations that the LM and RM can handle more reliably. We have written novel DSP programs for answering questions in open-domain, multi-hop, and conversational settings, establishing in early evaluations new state-of-the-art in-context learning results and delivering 37-120%, 8-39%, and 80-290% relative gains against the vanilla LM (GPT-3.5), a standard retrieve-then-read pipeline, and a contemporaneous self-ask pipeline, respectively.

Augmenting LMs by retrieving information from external knowledge resources is one promising solution. Most existing retrieval augmented LMs employ a retrieve-and-generate setup that only retrieves information once based on the input. This is limiting, however, in more general scenarios involving generation of long texts, where continually gathering information throughout generation is essential. In this work, we provide a generalized view of active retrieval augmented generation, methods that actively decide when and what to retrieve across the course of the generation. We propose Forward-Looking Active REtrieval augmented generation (FLARE), a generic method which iteratively uses a prediction of the upcoming sentence to anticipate future content, which is then utilized as a query to retrieve relevant documents to regenerate the sentence if it contains low-confidence tokens. We test FLARE along with baselines comprehensively over 4 long-form knowledge-intensive generation tasks/datasets. FLARE achieves superior or competitive performance on all tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.
