Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Despite this progress, evaluations predominantly focus on aesthetic appeal or alignment with text prompts. Consequently, there is limited understanding of whether these models can accurately represent a wide variety of realistic visual entities - a task requiring real-world knowledge. To address this gap, we propose a benchmark focused on evaluating Knowledge-InTensive image generaTion on real-world ENtities (i.e., KITTEN). Using KITTEN, we conduct a systematic study on the fidelity of entities in text-to-image generation models, focusing on their ability to generate a wide range of real-world visual entities, such as landmark buildings, aircraft, plants, and animals. We evaluate the latest text-to-image models and retrieval-augmented customization models using both automatic metrics and carefully-designed human evaluations, with an emphasis on the fidelity of entities in the generated images. Our findings reveal that even the most advanced text-to-image models often fail to generate entities with accurate visual details. Although retrieval-augmented models can enhance the fidelity of entity by incorporating reference images during testing, they often over-rely on these references and struggle to produce novel configurations of the entity as requested in creative text prompts.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-15,\n    authors: ['Hsin-Ping Huang', 'Xinyi Wang', 'Yonatan Bitton', 'Hagai Taitelbaum', 'Gaurav Singh Tomar', 'Ming-Wei Chang', 'Xuhui Jia', 'Kelvin C.K.

In parallel to the rise of end-to-end ASR systems, large language models (LLMs) have proven to be a versatile tool for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In NLP tasks where a database of relevant knowledge is available, retrieval augmented generation (RAG) has achieved impressive results when used with LLMs. In this work, we propose a RAG-like technique for correcting speech recognition entity name errors. Our approach uses a vector database to index a set of relevant entities. At runtime, database queries are generated from possibly errorful textual ASR hypotheses, and the entities retrieved using these queries are fed, along with the ASR hypotheses, to an LLM which has been adapted to correct ASR errors. Overall, our best system achieves 33%-39% relative word error rate reductions on synthetic test sets focused on voice assistant queries of rare music entities without regressing on the STOP test set, a publicly available voice assistant test set covering many domains.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-09-09,\n    authors: ['Ernest Pusateri', 'Anmol Walia', 'Anirudh Kashi', 'Bortik Bandyopadhyay', 'Nadia Hyder', 'Sayantan Mahinder', 'R.

Critic-Guided Planning with Retrieval-Augmentation for Solving Challenging Tasks,\n    abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities but may struggle with complex reasoning and factual correctness. Existing methods harness the strengths of chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to decompose a complex problem into simpler steps and apply retrieval to improve factual correctness. These methods work well on straightforward reasoning tasks but often falter on challenging tasks such as competitive programming and mathematics, due to frequent reasoning errors and irrelevant knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce Critic-guided planning with Retrieval-augmentation, CR-Planner, a novel framework that leverages fine-tuned critic models to guide both reasoning and retrieval processes through planning. CR-Planner solves a problem by iteratively selecting and executing sub-goals. Initially, it identifies the most promising sub-goal from reasoning, query generation, and retrieval, guided by rewards given by a critic model named sub-goal critic. It then executes this sub-goal through sampling and selecting the optimal output based on evaluations from another critic model named execution critic. This iterative process, informed by retrieved information and critic models, enables CR-Planner to effectively\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(CR-Planner) to tackle complex reasoning tasks more accurately than existing methods.\n\n  * The KITTEN benchmark focuses on evaluating the ability of text-to-image generation models to synthesize a wide range of realistic visual entities.
