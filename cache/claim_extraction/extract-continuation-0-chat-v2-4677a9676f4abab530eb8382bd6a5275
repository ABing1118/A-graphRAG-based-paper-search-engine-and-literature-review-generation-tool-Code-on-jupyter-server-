Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

The performance of RAG is greatly influenced by the retriever component, which typically relies on semantic similarity between the text embeddings of the query and the passages to identify the relevant context. However, text embedding models may only capture the semantic meaning of individual passages, potentially neglecting global relationships between them. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid retrieval method that integrates embeddings encoded from textual and knowledge graph information. Although in this paper, the knowledge graphs describe the passage relationships in a health-tech industry use case, the hybrid embedding solution is designed to be generic. Furthermore, the proposed retrieval approach aims to offer straight-forward implementation without requiring complex joint learning processes. Our results on custom test sets demonstrate significantly enhanced accuracy and ranking of the retriever, thus, supporting the LLM-based reader component in generating more accurate responses.,\n    publicationDate: None,\n    authors: ['Nguyen Nam Doan', 'Aki Härmä', 'Remzi Celebi', 'Valeria Gottardo'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: SafeRAG: Benchmarking Security in Retrieval-Augmented Generation of Large Language Model,\n    abstract: The indexing-retrieval-generation paradigm of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been highly successful in solving knowledge-intensive tasks by integrating external knowledge into large language models (LLMs). However, the incorporation of external and unverified knowledge increases the vulnerability of LLMs because attackers can perform attack tasks by manipulating knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a benchmark named SafeRAG designed to evaluate the RAG security. First, we classify attack tasks into silver noise, inter-context conflict, soft ad, and white Denial-of-Service.
