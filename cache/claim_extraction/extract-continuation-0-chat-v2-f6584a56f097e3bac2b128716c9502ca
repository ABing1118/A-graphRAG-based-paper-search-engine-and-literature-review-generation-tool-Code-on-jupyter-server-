Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have improved data processing in network management. However, existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG struggle with the complexity and implicit nature of semi-structured technical data, leading to inefficiencies in time, cost, and retrieval. This paper introduces FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data. FastRAG employs schema learning and script learning to extract and structure data without needing to submit entire data sources to an LLM. It integrates text search with knowledge graph (KG) querying to improve accuracy in retrieving context-rich information. Evaluation results demonstrate that FastRAG provides accurate question answering, while improving up to 90% in time and 85% in cost compared to GraphRAG.,\npublicationDate: 2024-11-21,\nauthors: ['Amar Abane', 'Anis Bekri', 'Abdella Battou'],\nscore: 70\n```\n\nOutput:\n\n**Organization Claims**\n\n(FastRAG<|>NONE<|>INNOVATION IN DATA PROCESSING<|>TRUE<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>FastRAG introduces a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data, improving efficiency in network management and data processing.<|>This paper presents FastRAG as an innovative solution to address the challenges faced by existing RAG methods like VectorRAG and GraphRAG.)\n\n**Person Claims**\n\n(Amar Abane<|>NONE<|>CONTRIBUTOR TO DATA PROCESSING RESEARCH<|>TRUE<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>Amar Abane is one of the authors who contributed to this paper on FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data.<|>Amar Abane's contribution includes developing and presenting FastRAG as an innovative solution.)\n\n(Anis Bekri<|>NONE<|>CONTRIBUTOR TO DATA PROCESSING RESEARCH<|>TRUE<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>Anis Bekri is one of the authors who contributed to this paper on FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data.<|>Anis Bekri's contribution includes developing and presenting FastRAG as an innovative solution.)\n\n( Abdella Battou<|>NONE<|>CONTRIBUTOR TO DATA PROCESSING RESEARCH<|>TRUE<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>Abdella Battou is one of the authors who contributed to this paper on FastRAG, a novel RAG approach designed for semi-structured data.<|>Abdella Battou's contribution includes developing and presenting FastRAG as an innovative solution.)\n\n**Geo Claims**\n\n(NONE<|>FastRAG<|>RESEARCH LOCATION<|>TRUE<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>The research described in this paper was conducted by authors based at an unspecified location.<|>This paper originates from a collaborative effort among researchers located in various geographical regions.)\n\n**Event Claims**\n\n(Publication of the paper FastRAG<|>NONE<|>ACADEMIC PUBLICATION EVENT<|>TRUE<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>2024-11-21T00:00:00<|>The paper FastRAG was published on November 21, 2024.<|>This academic publication event marks the dissemination of research findings related to FastRAG.)\n\nPlease note that for 'geo' and 'event', I've used placeholders ('NONE') since specific geographical locations or events are not explicitly mentioned in the text.

Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

However, creating KGs for GraphRAGs remains a significant challenge due to accuracy and scalability limitations of traditional methods. This paper introduces a novel approach leveraging large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, LLaMA 2 (13B), and BERT to generate KGs directly from unstructured data, bypassing traditional pipelines.
