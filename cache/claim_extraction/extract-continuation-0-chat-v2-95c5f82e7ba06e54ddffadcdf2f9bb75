Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim.

It is often challenging to generate high-quality audio for audio events that are unseen or uncommon in the training set. Inspired by the success of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in Large Language Model (LLM)-based knowledge-intensive tasks, we extend the TTA process with additional conditioning contexts. We propose Audiobox TTA-RAG, a novel retrieval-augmented TTA approach based on Audiobox, a conditional flow-matching audio generation model. Unlike the vanilla Audiobox TTA solution which generates audio conditioned on text, we augmented the conditioning input with retrieved audio samples that provide additional acoustic information to generate the target audio. Our retrieval method does not require the external database to have labeled audio, offering more practical use cases. To evaluate our proposed method, we curated test sets in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Our empirical results show that the proposed model can effectively leverage the retrieved audio samples and significantly improve zero-shot and few-shot TTA performance, with large margins on multiple evaluation metrics, while\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
