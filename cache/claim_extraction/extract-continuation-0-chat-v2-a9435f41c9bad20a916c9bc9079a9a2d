Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date.

Critic-Guided Planning with Retrieval-Augmentation for Solving Challenging Tasks,\n    abstract: State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive problem-solving capabilities but may struggle with complex reasoning and factual correctness. Existing methods harness the strengths of chain-of-thought and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to decompose a complex problem into simpler steps and apply retrieval to improve factual correctness. These methods work well on straightforward reasoning tasks but often falter on challenging tasks such as competitive programming and mathematics, due to frequent reasoning errors and irrelevant knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce Critic-guided planning with Retrieval-augmentation, CR-Planner, a novel framework that leverages fine-tuned critic models to guide both reasoning and retrieval processes through planning. CR-Planner solves a problem by iteratively selecting and executing sub-goals. Initially, it identifies the most promising sub-goal from reasoning, query generation, and retrieval, guided by rewards given by a critic model named sub-goal critic. It then executes this sub-goal through sampling and selecting the optimal output based on evaluations from another critic model named execution critic. This iterative process, informed by retrieved information and critic models, enables CR-Planner to effectively navigate the solution space towards the final answer. We employ Monte Carlo Tree Search to collect the data for training the critic models, allowing for a systematic exploration of action sequences and their long-term impacts. We validate CR-Planner on challenging domain-knowledge-intensive and reasoning-heavy tasks, including competitive programming, theorem-driven math reasoning, and complex domain retrieval problems. Our experiments demonstrate that CR-Planner significantly outperforms baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in addressing challenging problems by improving both reasoning and retrieval.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-02,\n    authors: ['Xingxuan Li', 'Weiwen Xu', 'Ruochen Zhao', 'Fangkai Jiao', 'Shafiq R.

One the one hand, LLMs sometimes struggle to generate reliable answers based on the black-box parametric knowledge, due to the lack of responsible knowledge. Moreover, fragmented knowledge facts extracted by knowledge retrievers fail to provide explicit and coherent reasoning paths for improving LLM reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose KG-CoT, a novel knowledge-augmented paradigm that leverages a small-scale step-by-step graph reasoning model to reason over knowledge graphs (KGs) and utilizes a reasoning path generation method to generate chains of reasoning with high confidence for large-scale LLMs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our KG-CoT significantly improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive question answering tasks, such as multi-hop, single-hop, and open-domain question answering benchmarks, without fine-tuning LLMs. KG-CoT outperforms the CoT prompting as well as prior retrieval-augmented and knowledge base question answering baselines. Moreover, KG-CoT can reduce the number of API calls and cost and generalize to various LLM backbones in a lightweight plug-and-play manner.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-08-01,\n    authors: ['Ruilin Zhao', 'Feng Zhao', 'Long Wang', 'Xianzhi Wang', 'Guandong Xu'],\n    score: 80.39720770839918\n},\n{\n    title: MRAG: A Modular Retrieval Framework for Time-Sensitive Question Answering,\n    abstract: Understanding temporal relations and answering time-sensitive questions is crucial yet a challenging task for question-answering systems powered by large language models (LLMs). Existing approaches either update the parametric knowledge of LLMs with new facts, which is resource-intensive and often impractical, or integrate LLMs with external knowledge retrieval (i.e., retrieval-augmented generation). However, off-the-shelf retrievers often struggle to identify relevant documents that require intensive temporal reasoning. To systematically study time-sensitive question answering, we introduce the TempRAGEval benchmark, which repurposes existing datasets by incorporating temporal perturbations and gold evidence labels. As anticipated, all existing retrieval methods struggle with these temporal reasoning-intensive questions. We further propose Modular Retrieval (MRAG), a trainless framework that includes three modules: (1) Question Processing that decomposes question into a main content and a temporal constraint; (2) Retrieval and Summarization that retrieves evidence and uses LLMs\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Document 1\n\n- Title: Can We Further Elicit Reasoning in LLMs?

These methods aim to systematically guide the reasoning process within LLMs.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThese documents collectively highlight advancements in leveraging large language models for complex tasks by integrating knowledge sources and employing sophisticated reasoning strategies. The focus on iterative processes, modular frameworks, and knowledge augmentation showcases a collaborative approach towards overcoming limitations in AI's ability to reason effectively and provide accurate answers across diverse domains."}]}
