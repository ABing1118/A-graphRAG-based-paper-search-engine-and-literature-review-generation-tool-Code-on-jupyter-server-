Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3. Return output in English as a single list of all the claims identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **##** as the list delimiter.\n\n4.

LLMs are highly successful in understanding the subtleties of language and processing context by being trained on large datasets. However, the difficulties encountered in Information Retrieval (IR) processes have created an awareness that these models are not sufficient on their own. Traditional IR methods have generally been insufficient in understanding the complexity of natural language in responding to specific queries and retrieving appropriate information from documents or databases. Since this process is based only on keywords, it cannot fully capture the semantic meaning of the language. For this reason, it has been necessary to go beyond traditional IR methods for more precise information creation based on context and meaning. As a result of these requirements, the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture has come to the fore. RAG offers the ability to create richer and contextually meaningful answers to user queries by integrating LLMs with information retrieval processes. This architecture allows the language model to instantly access external information sources; thus, it generates more accurate and contextual responses armed with existing information. These features of RAG provide appropriate solutions to users’ information-based demands by better understanding the complexity of natural language. In this study, it is emphasized that the integration of RAG architecture with information retrieval systems and LLMs provides more sensitive and accurate solutions in information-intensive tasks. This study emphasizes that the RAG architecture’s ability to retrieve information by dynamically using the learnings obtained from large datasets of LLMs strengthens applications in the field of NLP.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-12-06,\n    authors: ['Büşra Tural', 'Zeynep Örpek', 'Zeynep Destan'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Chain-of-Retrieval Augmented Generation,\n    abstract: This paper introduces an approach for training\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(COMPANY A<|>GOVERNMENT AGENCY B<|>ANTI-COMPETITIVE PRACTICES<|>TRUE<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>2022-01-10T00:00:00<|>Company A was found to engage in anti-competitive practices because it was fined for bid rigging in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B according to an article published on 2022/01/10<|>According to an article published on 2022/01/10, Company A was fined for bid rigging while participating in multiple public tenders published by Government Agency B.)\n##(LLM)<|>NONE<|>INFORMATION RETRIEVAL PROCESS<|>SUSPECTED<|>2023-01-01T00:00:00<|>2023-12-31T00:00:00<|>The difficulties encountered in Information Retrieval (IR) processes have created an awareness that traditional IR methods are not sufficient on their own.
