Extract all named entities that match the predefined entity specification. Entity specification can either be a list of entity names or a list of entity types.\n2. For each entity identified in step 1, extract all claims associated with the entity. Claims need to match the specified claim description, and the entity should be the subject of the claim.\nFor each claim, extract the following information:\n- Subject: name of the entity that is subject of the claim, capitalized. The subject entity is one that committed the action described in the claim. Subject needs to be one of the named entities identified in step 1.\n- Object: name of the entity that is object of the claim, capitalized. The object entity is one that either reports/handles or is affected by the action described in the claim. If object entity is unknown, use **NONE**.\n- Claim Type: overall category of the claim, capitalized. Name it in a way that can be repeated across multiple text inputs, so that similar claims share the same claim type\n- Claim Status: **TRUE**, **FALSE**, or **SUSPECTED**. TRUE means the claim is confirmed, FALSE means the claim is found to be False, SUSPECTED means the claim is not verified.\n- Claim Description: Detailed description explaining the reasoning behind the claim, together with all the related evidence and references.\n- Claim Date: Period (start_date, end_date) when the claim was made. Both start_date and end_date should be in ISO-8601 format. If the claim was made on a single date rather than a date range, set the same date for both start_date and end_date. If date is unknown, return **NONE**.\n- Claim Source Text: List of **all** quotes from the original text that are relevant to the claim.\n\nFormat each claim as (<subject_entity><|><object_entity><|><claim_type><|><claim_status><|><claim_start_date><|><claim_end_date><|><claim_description><|><claim_source>)\n\n3.

Another rule of camouflaged borrowing (ibid.) is: SL y ‘b’ TL(+PSM) {x}+{z} ‘b’ TL {x} ‘a’, {z} x is a lexical morpheme (e.g. root) that is phonetically similar to y; z is a grammatical morpheme (e.g. noun-pattern); {x}+{z} is one word; a is similar to b GALLURA should also have quality evaluation capabilities, e.g., evaluating a story generated (Peinado and Gervás, 2006), or evaluating morality within a story (Reeves, 1991). We also need to resort to computational argumentation: some such current research into argumentation in computer science looks into legal narratives (Bex, 2011). Explanation as sought in GALLURA need not necessarily be realistic; it is non-bona-fide (like in humour), and must conform to a set of conventions, of which realism is just a particular case (cf. Nissan, 2008). There are constraints on style: the output text generated conforms to the early rabbinic linguistic stratum and style (thus emulating the aggadic midrash), with constraints on which lexical items or morphological forms can be selected. Rabbinic stylemes are the subject of current IR research, including in the CUISINE text classifier. So are the identification of rabbinic citations, and chronological classification based on them. In fact, HaCohen-Kerner et al. (2010a) discussed stylistic feature sets for classification in CUISINE. Automated identification of citations from rabbinic texts has been researched (HaCohen-Kerner et al., 2010c). Automated classification of rabbinic KDIR \nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "<|COMPLETE|>"}]}
