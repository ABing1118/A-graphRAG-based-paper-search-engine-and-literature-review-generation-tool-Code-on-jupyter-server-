We introduce Contextual Knowledge Graph Construction (CKGC), a novel approach enhancing vector-based RAG by dynamically building a knowledge graph that reflects inherent data structures and connections.CKGC leverages text chunking, large language models (LLMs), and ontology mapping. By segmenting text and using LLMs to identify key entities and relationships, CKGC constructs a contextualized knowledge graph enriching information representation. This bridges the gap between semantic similarity and deeper contextual understanding, enabling more accurate and nuanced retrieval.Experiments on 2,000 lease agreements demonstrate that CKGC significantly improves vector-based RAG in information retrieval and question answering tasks, with substantial gains in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Top-k Accuracy. CKGC’s adaptability across domains positions it as a valuable tool for enhancing performance and understanding of complex textual data. Our findings underscore CKGC’s transformative potential in unlocking insights from vast text corpora, paving the way for more intelligent and context-aware information retrieval systems.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-11-29,\n    authors: ['Sagar Mankari', 'Abhishek Sanghavi'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title: Leveraging the Domain Adaptation of Retrieval Augmented Generation Models for Question Answering and Reducing Hallucination,\n    abstract: While ongoing advancements in Large Language Models have demonstrated remarkable success across various NLP tasks, Retrieval Augmented Generation Model stands out to be highly effective on downstream applications like Question Answering. Recently, RAG-end2end model further optimized the architecture and achieved notable performance improvements on domain adaptation. However, the effectiveness of these RAG-based architectures remains relatively unexplored when fine-tuned on specialized domains such as customer service for building a reliable conversational AI system. Furthermore, a critical challenge persists in reducing the occurrence of hallucinations while maintaining high domain-specific accuracy. In this paper, we investigated the performance of diverse RAG and RAG-like architectures through domain adaptation and evaluated their ability to generate accurate and relevant response grounded in the contextual knowledge base. To facilitate the evaluation of the models, we constructed a novel dataset HotelConvQA, sourced from wide range of hotel-related conversations and fine-tuned all the models on our domain specific dataset. We also addressed a critical research gap on determining the impact of domain adaptation on reducing hallucinations across different RAG architectures, an aspect that was not properly measured in prior work. Our evaluation shows positive results in all metrics by employing domain adaptation, demonstrating strong performance on QA tasks and providing insights into their efficacy in reducing hallucinations. Our findings clearly indicate that domain adaptation not only enhances the models' performance on QA tasks but also significantly reduces hallucination across all evaluated RAG architectures.,\n    publicationDate: 2024-10-23,\n    authors: ['Salman Rakin', 'Md.

They are even applied to generate simulation models for multibody systems from natural language. Research results suggest that LLMs surpass the mere replication of existing code examples, where some LLMs have been trained on an open-source multibody simulation code. However, for closed-source simulation software, such results are not to be expected as their ideas and concepts might differ from other publicly available ones. LLMs can hallucinate for knowledge-intensive tasks, such as model creation, which can lead to wrong responses. This is especially the case for the LLM unknown closed-source simulation software. The same applies to other internal knowledge kept private to protect intellectual property or data privacy. The Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach might yield a solution for these knowledge-intensive tasks. This paper explores the application of RAG to closed-source simulation software and presents first experiments. After a brief introduction to LLMs, the RAG approach, and the simulation method applied by the close-source simulation software, several examples are provided to test LLMs' knowledge of the simulation software and the creation of simulation models using two RAG systems. The examples show promising results indicating the benefits of applying RAG systems to closed-source simulation software, helping to access their knowledge. Nevertheless, they also reveal gaps in the applied information and open questions for further research.,\n    publicationDate: 2025-02-06,\n    authors: ['Andreas Baumann', 'Peter Eberhard'],\n    score: 70\n},\n{\n    title:\nOutput:"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(Checking through the provided text, there doesn't seem to be any specific information that can be directly extracted into a concise answer format as requested.
